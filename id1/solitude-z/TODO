TODO for 0.16:

x do something to make zquake-gl (Win32) start up in 640x480 by default instead of 640x400!
x proper directinput with wheel and 3rd button (or make in_dinput default to 0 again)
- temporarily disable bot support and vwep support for the release
x fix snd_restart in Linux
x fix the splitscreen bug in X11
- fuh's fixes for new cl_cam code (look up on zq board)

Can do without these:
- fix software gamma from config.cfg -> gl_gamma on gamedir change.
- make cl_hightrack work?


Windows Client
--------------

.

Linux Client
------------
 
* Add strider's evdev input support

* Fix up HWGamma, affects the whole screen for gamma and blends, need to
  restore the gamma etc when you alt tab, lose focus, minimise etc.
  
* Speaking of alt-tab, work out how to make alt-tabbing work with GLX
  client.
 
* ALSA support maybe - oss emulation seems to work fine but native code is
  always better.
  
* Consider SDL for input

Windows/Linux Server
--------------------

* Allow rcon to save settings to a config? e.g. rcon writeconfig?

* Maplist - return *.bsp from id1/maps and $gamedir/maps

- free loaded wad3s every now and then
- don't Mod_ClearAll, use Mod_TouchModel like NetQuake
- FTE-style non-transparent protocol extension negotiation
+ revert my fragmented backbuf stuff to QW's solid backbufs (the former give no advantage at all as I've realized)
