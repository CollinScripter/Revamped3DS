--------
enginez is an open source (GPL) modification of ID Software's Quakeworld.

Installation Notes
------------------
Most people can skip straight to step 2.

STEP 1
You need id1/pak0.pak installed by the original ID's Quake.  If you do not have
a copy of Quake, the shareware version will do.  You can download id's
shareware version of Quake 1 from here :

The id1/pak1.pak is also important but not necessary.  This can only be obtained from the
full version of Quake made by ID Software.

STEP2
For a quick installation:
Simply unzip the enginez zip into your quake folder and run enginez-gl.exe (or
enginez.exe).  Press escape to bring up the menu and start a single player game!
