// ----------- REVISION HISTORY ------------
//$Log: UserData\040KingPin.qrk,v $
//Revision 1.8  2008/05/21 18:14:51  cdunde
//To add and\or activate Half-Life 2 functions: (all original code by Alexander)
//1) to create extra Specifics setting handles for func_useableladder function (point0 & point1)
//      func_breakable_glass and func_breakable_surf functions
//      (lowerleft, upperleft, lowerright and upperright)
//2) to draw special light entity lines for functions like light_spot that have the Specifics
//      (angles, _cone, spotlightwidth and\or _inner_cone)
//3) face displacement. Commented out at this time. believe bezier type code should be used instead.
//
//Revision 1.7  2008/05/14 20:38:20  cdunde
//Fixed basic lighting in all games and a few other small typo errors.
//
//Revision 1.6  2008/03/25 06:43:13  cdunde
//To standardize UserData files as much as possible based on their game engine type.
//Moved entities out of them which were duplicated in their game Data files, should NEVER be allowed!
//Changed all hard coded texturing to either auto or includes, also should NEVER be allowed.
//
//Revision 1.5  2005/10/15 01:00:27  cdunde
//To reinstate headers and history
//
