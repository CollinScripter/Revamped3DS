Notes on the Mohaa file:
========================

The weapon entity data in the included qrk file was just "mocked"
to fit in with the rest of the other entites in the qrk file.
The weapon entity names were taken from MOHradiant

Other Notes:
===========

I have recieved information that for the weapon entities to work,
for every map you create, you have to make a script file with the
same name as your map. The ligitimacy of this info is unkown.

												Happy Mapping!!
