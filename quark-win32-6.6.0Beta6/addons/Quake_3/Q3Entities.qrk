//Revision 1.5  2008/05/21 18:15:23  cdunde
//To add and\or activate Half-Life 2 functions: (all original code by Alexander)
//1) to create extra Specifics setting handles for func_useableladder function (point0 & point1)
//      func_breakable_glass and func_breakable_surf functions
//      (lowerleft, upperleft, lowerright and upperright)
//2) to draw special light entity lines for functions like light_spot that have the Specifics
//      (angles, _cone, spotlightwidth and\or _inner_cone)
//3) face displacement. Commented out at this time. believe bezier type code should be used instead.
//
//Revision 1.4  2008/05/14 20:38:57  cdunde
