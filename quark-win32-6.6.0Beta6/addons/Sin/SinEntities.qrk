// ----------- REVISION HISTORY ------------
//$Log: SinEntities.qrk,v $
//Revision 1.3  2008/05/21 18:15:16  cdunde
//To add and\or activate Half-Life 2 functions: (all original code by Alexander)
//1) to create extra Specifics setting handles for func_useableladder function (point0 & point1)
//      func_breakable_glass and func_breakable_surf functions
//      (lowerleft, upperleft, lowerright and upperright)
//2) to draw special light entity lines for functions like light_spot that have the Specifics
//      (angles, _cone, spotlightwidth and\or _inner_cone)
//3) face displacement. Commented out at this time. believe bezier type code should be used instead.
//

//Fixed basic lighting in all games and a few other small typo errors.
//
//Revision 1.1  2008/03/28 19:11:46  cdunde
//Cleaned up, fixed if needed and brought into sync with all QuArK addons.
//
