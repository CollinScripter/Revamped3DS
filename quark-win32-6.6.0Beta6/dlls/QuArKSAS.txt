QuArK SAS (Steam Access System)
-------------------------------
Version 1.02
6 February 2010



Program description
-------------------
QuArK SAS is a small command-line utility that allows you to extract files from Steam. For this to work, Steam must be running, and you probably have to be logged in. It produces a log-file which easily allows diagnoses when the program for some reason doesn't work. It's designed to be as light-weighted as possible (that's why there is no GUI), and run on as many systems as possible.

The executable file has to be placed in the right folder to work:
old:       %Steam%/steamapps/%username%/sourcesdk/bin
ep1:       %Steam%/steamapps/%username%/sourcesdk/bin/ep1/bin
orangebox: %Steam%/steamapps/%username%/sourcesdk/bin/orangebox/bin

When not placed in a correct directory, it will not be able to find several Steam files (like tier0.dll) and will crash on startup.

Also, use QuArKSAS.exe for the ep1 directory, and QuArKSAS_orangebox.exe for the orangebox directory.



Program usage
-------------
This is a direct copy from the program:

QuArKSAS.exe [parameters] <filenames>
<filenames>: All the filenames of the files to extract.

Available parameters:
-g <ID>: Set Steam game number (default: 220 (HL2)).
-gamedir <directory>: The game directory containing the to extract files.
-help: Displays this information.
-o <directory>: Specifies the output directory.
-overwrite: Overwrite any existing output files.
-v <number>: Verbose log level. 0 is least output, 40 is max.
/?: Displays this information.


After all parameters have been read from left to right,
the rest will be interpreted as <filenames>.

Note: all parameters are case-sensitive.
Note: do NOT include trailing slashes in pathnames!

Notes
-----
This program is used by the map/model editor QuArK (hence the name). However, it's free and open-source, so anybody can use this as they please (also see 'License' below). If you don't like the QuArK part of the name, simply call it QSAS :)
