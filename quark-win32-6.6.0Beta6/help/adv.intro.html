<p>QuArK development can be carried out at three levels:
</p><p><ul>
<li>the *.qrk configuration files
</p><p><li>the Python code
</p><p><li>the Delphi code.
</ul>
</p><p>The first two require just a text-editor, since a functioning QuArK
installation includes the Python interpreter, while the last requires
Delphi (Borland's version of Pascal, enhanced with visual development
tools).  The current developers seem to be using versions 6 or 7;
it's possible that older versions such as 3 or even 2, might work.
Older versions can sometimes be acquired free on computer magazine
CD's.  The Delphi is written in a mixture of French and English,
and the French is slowly being converted to English (so there is
a possibility that some references to things in the Delphi here
will be outdated).
</p><p>TC's can typically be supported by creating new *.qrk files in the
form of `addons', while supporting a new game usually requires some
Delphi coding (mostly because each game tends to introduce some quirks
into the texture and map formats, and the read/write code for these
needs to be reasonably fast).  Interface ideas on the other hand can
often be supported just in Python, with maybe a little bit of Delphi
to support a new `specific type' in a form (if you have a bright idea
and think you need a new specific type, some Delphi coder might
well be able to provide it).
</p><p>Central to everything is the concept of `QObject', QuArK's universal
format for the storage and management of structured information.
Maps, game information supplied in add-ons, and the descriptions of
most of the dialog boxes and other data-entry windows in QuArK are
all described as QOjects.  The .Qrk files are just QObjects presented
in a written format for QObjects, and understanding
them is essential for following the Python and Delphi as well.
</p><p>A QObject is a thing (technically an instance of a class in Delphi)
with two kinds of properties:
<ul>
<li>A list of attributes called `Specifics', each with a value, which
    might be a string, a number, a sequence of numbers or a few
    other things.
<li>A list of `subelements' (SubElements in the Delphi, .subitems
    in the Python), each of which is just another QObject.
</ul>
</p><p>So a face is a QObject with a `v' specific of 9 numbers indicating
the face and texture position information (the location of the
corner and two ends of the Cyan L), and a `tex' specific giving
the name of the texture.  You can see the specifics of a map object
by hitting the second button over the multi-page panel (it's usually
only interesting for entities).
</p><p>And a poly (brush) is a QObject whose list of subitems are the non-shared
faces of that poly (shared faces appear in the subitem list of the group
containing that poly).  And so on.
</p><p>There's one special specific that should always be there, and maybe
shouldn't be thought of as a specific at all, and that is `name'.
A QObject's name is divided into two parts, shortname and extension.
The shortname is usually just an identifying label (tho for entities
it's the classname), but the extension, separated by a dot or colon,
specifies the kind of object.  The dot separator is used for types of
QObjects that can plausibly be stored in a file of their own (so they
are in effect a file-type), while the colons are for smaller types
of objects, such as the different components of a map.
</p><p>Here are some of the more important extensions:
<ul>
<li>.qctx - Quake Context.  Contains info that modifies how things are done
<li>.qtx - Toolbox.  Collection of objects that can be chosen from and inserted into something.
<li>.qtxfolder - folder in .qtx
<li>:form - specifies a format for a window whereby info about something
    is entered into QuArK.  To support a mod, you'll have to
    get familiar with the :form object associated with each
    entity; these are found in the entity forms.qctx of the .qrk
<li>:f - face
<li>:p - poly (brush; faces in subitems thereof, shortname arbitrary label)
<li>:g - group (contained faces, brushes &amp; entities in subitems, shortname arbitrary label)
<li>:b - brush entity (attached brushes in subitems, entity attributes in specifics, shortname = classname)
<li>:b2 - (quadratic) bezier patch or quilt
<li>:e - point entity (entity attributes in specifics, shortname = classname)
</ul>
</p><p>Because each specific has a unique identifying name, the order of the
specifics list doesn't matter, but the subelements don't have labels;
for map objects, they are displayed in the tree-view, and the order is
as given.  In principle you could make something depend on it, tho I
don't think anyone ever has).
</p><p>It might be useful to note that QObjects are sort of like a limited
form of XML, with no character data interspersed between subelements.
With QObjects in hand, we push on to .qrk's.

Useful additions:
  *a rundown of the major compoments of a game-support file and an addon file.
  *a guide to Typ's in :form's
</pre>

<p>.qrk files are just QObjects stored in files.  There are actually
two kinds of .qrk files, text and binary (both unfortunately with
the extension .qrk).  The text files can be read an edited with
a text-editor (although the format is initially forbidding), whereas
the binaries are much more compact, and allow `delay loading'
which helps QuArK manage big ones with less chugging.
</p><p>To get a text version of a binary *.qrk, just open it, and save then save
it (as `structured text', with the extension .txt to keep the file system
happy).  The `technical info' zips for the older QuArK versions,
and the current development snapshots, contain the
text versions of the *.qrk files, which furthermore tend to contain useful
information such as comments on the syntax, etc.
</p><p>A (text format) .Qrk begins with the line `QQRKSRC1', which says
that it's a QuArK text format file.  Then there can be comment
lines beginning with `//' (everything after `//' on a line is
igored), whitespace and blank lines etc. until we get down to
business with a line whose first nonblack character is:
</p><p>  '{'.
</p><p>'{' opens a QObject.  We already know that QObjects have two
`Specifics' (name-value pairs), and `Subitems', which are
QObjects which will have a `name' specific.  So it's not too
surprising that the rest of a QObject will consist of a series
of pairs:
</p><div class="doccode"><pre>
  &lt;Name&gt; = &lt;Value&gt;
</pre></div>

<p>  (where &lt;Value&gt; can be as large an expanse of text as you like,
   if it's a great big QOobject)
</p><p>Until we fetch up at the end with the closing `}', after which the
file must end.
</p><p>So let's look at the beginning of the Portal of Praevus add-on
(I started as a Hexen II entity guy, so we gotta have some Hx2
content here ...)
</p><div class="doccode"><pre>
QQRKSRC1
// This file has been written by QuArK Version 5.0.b5
// It's the text version of file: Praevus.qrk
// Portal of Praevus add-on by tiglari@hexenworld.com
//   to be added on to datah2.qrk (data file for Hexen II)
//
// The Textures need to be further subsorted into wall, floor/ceiling,
//  button, etc; if you want to do this please do, it's not rocket
//  science!

{
  QuArKProtected = &quot;1&quot;
  Description = &quot;Portal of Praevus Data&quot;

    praevus directory infos.qctx =
    {
        Game = &quot;Hexen II&quot;
        SourceDir = &quot;PORTALS&quot;
//      GameDir = &quot;fortress&quot;
    }
</pre></div>

<p>After the opening guff, we see that the first specific is
`QuArKProtected'. This will cause a warning to pop up whenever QuArK
tries to save/overwrite this file (only use this if the file is
considered part of QuArK).  'QuArKProtected''s value is a string, enclosed
in quotes.  There are several other schemes for representing values, such
as Hex codes, which we'll get into shortly.
</p><p>Then comes our first subelement.  Its Name specific will be
`praevus directory infos.qctx'.  Its shortname is `praevus directory infos'
and its extension is .qctx, so it's a Quake Context, and modifies
how things are done (here where to look for info about the game).
This particular QObject has two ordinary string-specifics,
and then ends.  So it goes on with more subelements until the final
'}' on line 6108.
</p><p>So that's the basic idea, but there is a bit more to it than that.
</p><p>First, in addition to strings, there are several additional types of
specific-values.  Binary data is introduced with `$'.  So for example
the line from the Defaults.qrk file prescribing the red default
color for tags is:
</p><div class="doccode"><pre>
  Tag        = $FF0000
</pre></div>

<p>(a standard <a href="glossary.html#r">RGB</a> color code, for those new to such things)
</p><p>Multiline strings can be specified as sequences of ordinary &quot;-bounded
strings separated by `$0D':
</p><div class="doccode"><pre>
  Hint = &quot;This ought to work&quot;
      $0D&quot;  if it doesn't, why not try extreme skiing?&quot;
</pre></div>

<p>And sequences of numbers are bounded by ', a bounding box for example
might be specified as:
</p><div class="doccode"><pre>
     bbox = '-8 -8 -8 8 8 8'
</pre></div>

<p>All this and some more stuff that I haven't seen exemplified is
prescribed in the function ConstructObjsFromText
in the file QkFileObject.
</p><p>* sections on the major components of the major kinds of .qrk file would go nicely here *
</p><p><strong>Forms:</strong>
 For game supporters, one of the most important kinds of components
 of .qrk files are :forms, since these control how the specifics
 of entities are entered into maps.  :forms are also important
 in Python coding, since they are used to control in making dialog
 boxes, etc.
</p><p> To get a sense of how it goes, here's the beginning of the entity
 forms specifications from DATAH2.QRK:
</p><div class="doccode"><pre>
   Entity forms.qctx =
   {  // ENTFRM
     Ring_Flight:form =
     {
      Help = &quot;Ring of Flight&quot;
      bbox = '-8 -8 -44 8 8 20'
      mdl = &quot;models/ringft.mdl&quot;
     more: = {
       Typ=&quot;B&quot;
       Txt=&quot;triggering&quot;
       Cap=&quot;Push&quot;
       Form=&quot;item_triggers:form&quot;
       Hint=&quot;specifics for triggering when item is taken&quot;
     }
      spawnflags: =
        {Txt=&quot;&amp;&quot;
         Typ=&quot;X1&quot;
         Cap=&quot;FLOAT&quot;
         Hint=&quot;item doesn't drop to floor when spawned  &quot;}
     }
     Ring_Regeneration:form =
     { ...
     ....
</pre></div>

<p>Entity Forms is a Quake Context, its subitems are a (big) list of
:form objects.  These have some specifics (all QObjects, regardless
of type, can have specifics freely added to them), and then comes
a list of subitems.  Each subitem is a little window, `control'
or `widget' (GUI geekspeak) whereby some attribute of the entity
can be set by the editor.  I need to call them something, so I'll
call them `fields'.
</p><p>The way fields work is a bit devious.  They have names like `more:',
`spawnflags:', etc. (colon, null extension). Then inside the brackets are
listed further specifics, of which the most important is `Typ'.  Typ
determines what kind of control is used; X1 for example is a checkbox that
sets the first bit position (flag) in an integer.  Usually the name
determines what attribute of the entity is being set, so the `spawnflags'
subitem sets the the first bit position of the `spawnflags' attribute of
the entity.  But not always; `more:' above is just a label.
</p><p>Another important specific of fields is `Txt'.  This is the `label'
that appears to the left of the data-entry widget itself.  If it's
&quot;&amp;&quot;, then the name of the field is used as the label, so if you look
at entity specifics in the map editor, you'll see the name of the
various entity attributes on the left, their values on the right
(in the data-entry widgets).  Their are various further field specifics,
&quot;Cap&quot; for additional text (appearing on the right) and &quot;Hint&quot;,
for flyover hints, and whatever more the delphi code for that
kind of Typ happends to support.  So the :more button calls up
an additional window for entering further specifics, its form is
given as the value of the Form specific.
</p><p>Unfortunately, there is no solid list of all the Typs (programmers
might like to know that they're defined in a big cascade of
Case statements in prog/FormCfg.pas:TFormCfg..wmMessageInterne;
once you've got the hang of it, it's not too hard to add new ones,
without fully understanding everything that's going on).  Browsing
in the text versions of the game support files, especially dataq2.qrk,
is a way to get started learning them.
</p><p> * A guide to Typ's would also be nice to have *

<p>Typ's are used in all kinds of forms but the most common are <a href="adv.quarkpy.gui.html#dialogs">Dialog Boxes</a>.
These are placed within tripple double quotes <a href="glossary.html#"">"""</a> and ends with them also, because it's a multi-line string.<br>
A <b>very important</b> thing to know and remember about this is how to use a Python defined variable within this
tripple double quotes area.
</p><p>First the variable, which can also be a stored setting, must be defind before and outside of the above area like this:
<div class="doccode"><pre>
    NbrOfLines = &quot;10&quot;
</pre></div>
Then that variable can be used within the tripple double quotes area like this:
</p><div class="doccode"><pre>
    mesh_shader: = {Typ=&quot;M&quot;
                    Rows = &quot;&quot;&quot; + chr(34) + NbrOfLines + chr(34) + &quot;&quot;&quot;
                    Scrollbars=&quot;1&quot;
                    Txt = &quot;mesh shader&quot;
                    Hint=&quot;Contains the full text of this skin texture's shader, if any.&quot;$0D
                         &quot;This can be copied to a text file, changed and saved.&quot;
                   }
</pre></div>
The <a href="glossary.html#c">chr(34)</a> items, which is for a single double quote, must be used like this to avoid confusion with the tripple double quotes.

<p>Here is a list of the most common used Typ's in .QRK :form definitions.
</p><p>Almost all components have some standard specifics you can use:
</p><p><u>Hint</u> - displays a help message when the cursor hovers over the item. You can have spread it on several lines.<br>A valid text can look like this:
</p><div class="doccode"><pre>
Hint = &quot;Help text&quot;$ODOD&quot;How to spr&quot;
       &quot;ead text on several lines.&quot;
</pre></div>

<p>The dollar sign is used to enter one or more special/invisible characters. In this case two new-line characters.<br>It is also valid to cut the text off and begin a new line if it becomes too long.<br>The above Hint will display:
</p><p><b>Help text
</p><p>How to spread text on several lines.</b>
</p><p><u>Txt</u> - defines the lable. Labels are special in QuArK. If you set their value to &quot;&amp;&quot; they will display the name of the component.<br>So if you have defined a component like this:
</p><div class="doccode"><pre>
name: = { Typ=&quot;E&quot; Txt=&quot;&amp;&quot; } 
</pre></div>

<p>you will get 'name' as caption for this entry field. This is often used for the labels of entity specifics.
</p><p><u>SelectMe</u> - set this to one and the component will become selected when its window/dialog is displayed.<br>This should be used on the first
component on a dialog only, as it may be confusing to have input directed<br>to a component in the middle from the beginning. 
</p><p><b>Note:</b> The first character of Typ works as a flag. If you use a lower-case character the button/entry field will fill<br>all available space
its caption (Txt) does not occupy.

<b>This is a list of specifics that effect the path<br>
handling for the Typ=&quot;EP&quot; above</b>.
</td><td>
<pre>
1) <b>Typ=&quot;EP&quot;</b> opens the file browser window.
2) <b>Txt=&quot;Path to QBSP&quot;</b> gives the title at the top of the window.
3) <b>DefExt=&quot;md2; *.map; *.pcx&quot;</b> sets the type of file/files to accept.
                          Set it to &quot;*&quot; if file type does't matter.
4) <b>BasePath=&quot;$Game&quot;</b> sets the Directory that the browser window
                           will start with.
                      $Game will be converted to the game
                           directory... for example &quot;C:\Quake2&quot;.
5) <b>CutPath=&quot;$Game\?\&quot;</b> will be cut off the beginning of the
                           full path string.
                      $Game is the same as above.
                      ? means that there HAS to be a directory.
                      * means that there may or may not be a
                           directory and only stands for ONE
                           directory. For example
               &quot;$Game\?\sprites\*\&quot; accepts all of the following:
                           C:\Quake2\baseq2\sprites\abc.spr
                           C:\Quake2\xyz\sprites\xyz\abc.spr
                      but not:
                           C:\Quake2\baseq2\sprites\a\b\c\abc.spr
6) <b>DirSep=&quot;/&quot;</b> Quake games use '/' as path separator. Using this
                   specific will convert all the &quot;\&quot; to &quot;/&quot;.
                   Many games don't use the Windows directory
                   separator '\'. Instead they use '/'.
7) <b>AugPath=&quot;../ &quot;</b>  will augment the modified path and add ../ to
                           it at the beginning. The DirSep specific
                           above does not effect this specific,
                           so proper coding should be used.

<p>1. Intro
</p><p>OOP, or object-oriented programming, is a programming methodology
developed in the 70s that became popular in the 80s for building
large and complex programs, such as especially GUI applications,
of which QuArK is a fine instance.  Popular OOP languages include
C++, Java, Object Pascal/Delphi and Python.  There are both subtle
and obvious differences between the approaches taken by all of these
languages, but there is also a lot of commonality, such that someone
already familiar with OOP from the first three mentioned languages
can probably pick up what they need to know about Python OOP from
the documentation and QuArK code.
</p><p>2.  Basic Objects
</p><p>An object is basically a chunk of the computer's memory that has been
organized to provide storage for some data, and methods for
changing it and reading it.  So it's like a 'struct' in C,
or a 'record' in Pascal, but more powerful.  For a simple example
that's not totally irrelevant to a geometry-managing program such
as QuArK, suppose we have circles to manage.  A circle can be
characterized by the three coordinates of its center, and by its
radius:
</p><div class="doccode"><pre>
  class Circle:
      x = 1
      y = 0
      z = 5
      r = 1.5
</pre></div>

<p>(Important: watch your letters, they are case sensitive.)
</p><p>Or you can just create the object by writing:
</p><div class="doccode"><pre>
  class Circle:
      pass
</pre></div>

<p>and add the data later:
</p><div class="doccode"><pre>
  Circle.x = 1
  Circle.y = 0
  Circle.z = 5
  Circle.r = 1.5
</pre></div>
The '.' separates the name of the class itself from its 'attributes'.

<p>Whichever you've done, you can get the data back later (Delphi users
take note: there's no 'with' statement, since Guido van Rossum, Python's
creator, finds them harmful to programs' maintainability).  So if
either of the above is in a file 'circles.py', in the Python
interpreter you can write:
<div class="doccode"><pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; import plugins.circles         [you type]
&gt;&gt;&gt; plugins.circles.Circle.r       [ditto]
1.5                        [Python answers]
</pre></div>
</p><p>Note that Python is <strong>much</strong> more liberal than C++,
Object Pascal/Delphi, or Java, since in these languages you'd have
to declare your object as belonging to a 'type', and say what kinds
of 'data members' it could have, in advance of using it.
</p><p>This rather minimalistic sort of class has its uses (for example
as a package for passing bundles of data round in the 'live edit dialog'
facility (LiveEditDlg in quarkpy.dlgclasses), but to make classes
really worthwhile several closely related new ideas are needed, first
instances and methods, and later, inheritance.
</p><p>2. Methods and Instances
</p><p>A method is basically a function, closely associated with an object,
for doing something involving its data (adding data, reading it,
performing some calculation involving it and returning the result,
or whatever).   For example having created a circle, we might
want to access its circumference and area; the idea is that
we'll write things like
<div class="doccode"><pre>
answer =  plugins.circle.circumference()
</pre></div>
(plugins because that is the folder in which the circles.py file will be located.)
</p><p>(Parentheses because this is going to be produced by a kind of function,
and functions are marked in Python by parentheses.)
</p><p>But to do this in a sensible way we need to distinguish two slightly
different notions, 'circle' as a particular object, and 'circle' as
a template for making objects.  Different circles will have different
centers and radii, but use the same method to make them.  So we need a way to
define both a template and a method for making things that fit it.  Templates
for objects are what 'classes' are really supposed to be, and the methods
for making particular objects, 'instances', are called 'constructors.
</p><p>In Python, constructors all have the same name, '__init__': the double
underscores on either side are a signal that something with special
meaning for Python is involved.  All methods, including constructors,
are defined as functions internal to the class, so their definitions
start with 'def'.  And these functions have 'self' as their first
argument, which always refers to the object (being created, if the
function is a constructor).  So the revised definition for the circle
class might look like this:
<div class="doccode"><pre>
import math

class Circle:
    def __init__(self, x, y, z, r):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
        self.z = z
        self.radius = r

    def circumference(self):
        return self.radius*math.pi

    def radius(self):
        return self.radius
</pre></div>
The constructor <b>attaches</b> the three coordinates and the radius as
'data members' of the object <b>self</b> it creates, and there are two methods
to write this; the second is included to help people who can't remember whether
to write circle.radius or circle.radius() (pretty much anybody who's
focused on content rather than punctuation).  We've used uppercase
for the name of our class, in accord with a sensible but not always
obeyed convention to use uppercase to start 'template' names,
lowercase for 'instance names'.
</p><p>At this point, we have completed the creation of our class.
Because we write this code in a text editor we need to save it as a
Python file, in this case as 'circles.py', and include 'import math'
(because we have used its <b>pi</b> function in our 'def circumference')
in front of the 'circles' definition, before we save it. We then need to
move the 'circles.py' file to the plugins folder. As a matter of good
coding practice, the 'import' and 'from' statements are usually grouped
together at the beginning of the Python file.
</p><p>At this point we could continue to add more code, to this file, to apply
(or use) the 'class Circle' and its definitions we just created, or we can
create another Python 'plugin' file and 'import circles' to there, which is
what we will do now just to demonstrate how files can pass data and functions.
</p><p>So we will now write another simple 'plugin' Python file (and save that to the
plugins folder as well) with the following code to see the effect of the
Circle class in the circles.py file:
<div class="doccode"><pre>
import quarkpy.qmacro   # to bring in qmacro functions we need
import quarkx           # to bring in quarkx functions we need
from circles import *   # to bring in all of our circle class

def printcir(self):
    circle = Circle(1,0,3,1.5)  # assigns values to the attributes
    circle.circumference()      # passes the values to circle class
    answer = circle.circumference()  # collects the 'return' data
    print answer                # prints the answer to the console
</pre></div>
This will pass the three coordinates of 1,0,3 (for x,y,z) and
the radius of 1.5 to the Circle class which will process it then
'return' the 'answer' of 4.71238898038 that will be printed to the console.
</p><p>But before we can save this file, we need to add some code to create a
menu item, that we can use to activate (or call) the 'printcir' function:
<div class="doccode"><pre>
def WindowClick(self):
    import quarkpy.mapoptions   # brings in the 'Options' menu
    printcir(self)              # calls our function
    quarkx.console(1)           # brings the console into view

quarkpy.mapoptions.items.append(quarkpy.qmenu.item(&quot;&amp;Print Cir.&quot;, 
WindowClick)) # adds it to the 'Options' menu
</pre></div>
Now we can save this 'plugin' file as well, calling it something like ' mapcircles.py ',
to the plugins folder. You can either cut-n-paste these scripts to a text editor
to create your own files as we have discussed, or use the ones provided here,
<a href="zips">OOP_examples.zip</a>, of working examples for this tutorial (and others)
in the 'zips' sub-folder of your QuArK-help folder on your hard drive.
</p><p>For a concrete example of some rather basic classes, look at the
two kinds of menu items defined in quarkpy.qmenu, 'item', and 'popup'.
These classes have only constructors, and no other methods, and all
the constructors do is attach the same parameters as data members,
and add in some extra default stuff, such as 'normal' as a value
of 'state'.    Note that functions, such as 'onclick'. can be attached
to objects by constructors (but these aren't methods).
</p>
<p>3. Inheritance
</p><p>The final thing we need for a real OOP system is inheritance, which
is basing classes on other classes.  In a real geometry-managing
program we'd have lots of different shapes, with various features.
For example points wouldn't have radius or circumference (perhaps),
but they would have a 'center' or 'origin', like all other figures.
So we might define:
</p><div class="doccode"><pre>
class Figure
    def __init__(self, x, y ,z):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
        self.z = z

    def origin(self):
    def origin(self):
        return self.x, self.y, self.z
</pre></div>
Now we might want at least two 'derived classes', or 'subclasses', Point
and Circle, so we might write something like this:
<div class="doccode"><pre>
class Point(Figure):
    pass

class Circle(Figure)
    def __init__(x, y, z, r):
        Figure.__init__(self, x, y, z)
        self.radius = r

    def circumference(self):
        return self.radius*math.pi

    def radius(self):
        return self.radius
</pre></div>
The Point class is strictly cosmetic: there's a sensible opinion to the
effect that subclasses ought to be more specialized than their parents,
not just different (golden lab is a good subclass of dog, but not of cat).
Circles aren't kinds of points, but the point class doesn't add anything
to our Figure concept (at least yet).  So we define it as a subclass
of Figure with no new content; note that the 'base class' <b>(Figure)</b>
is put in parentheses.

<p>A derived class 'inherits' all methods and data members from its parent, so we
can write something like:
<div class="doccode"><pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt;from Figures import *
&gt;&gt;&gt;point = Point(1,1,1)
&gt;&gt;&gt;point.origin()
</pre></div>
and get
<div class="doccode"><pre>
(1,1,1)
</pre></div>
in reply.
</p><p>In addition to being inherited, methods (and data members) can be 'overridden':
if the derived class defines a method or data member with the same name as
one of the parent class, then the definition in the derived class is normally
used rather than in the parent, for instances of the derived class.  This is
illustrated with the second constructor __init__() of class Circle with the code
line of Figure.__init__(self, x, y, z) as shown above in the script.
</p><p>However, sometimes we need to get at the parent method, which is also illustrated
in this constructor: when one name is put in front of another with '.', we say
that the first name is a qualifier of the second.  So to get at the parent's definition,
we qualify the method name with the name of the parent class, but when we do
this we have to provide the 'self' argument explicitly.  Indeed, any method of
any class can be used in this way, qualifying it with the class name and providing
the first argument.
</p><p>So what is the difference between a method and a function that just happens to
have been attached to an object, such as the onclick function for qmenu.item?
First, only methods participate in inheritance, and second, only methods can be
called via the shortcut technique with an instance as qualifier, and automatically
supplied as first argument (but you could write something like Circle.circumference(mycircle)
instead of mycircle.circumference(), if you wanted to).
</p><p>Unfortunately I haven't been able to find any really simple example of a base class
and some subclasses in the QuArK code.  Some important ones are the dialog boxes,
base class dialogbox in quarkpy.qmacro, and the handles, base class GenericHandle
in qhandles.py.  But there's lots of stuff in them.  An example of a subclass of
dialogbox is SimpleCancelDlgBox defined in quarkpy.qeditor; you can find further
subclasses of SimpleCancelDlgBox by searching for 'CancelDlgBox)' (the final
parenthesis picks up that it's being used as a base class in a class statement).
There is much more to Python classes than this; it wouldn't be a bad idea to
look over the classes section in the tutorial, although there's a fair amount
of stuff that wouldn't make much sense to beginners (but also some reasonably 
straightforward examples.
</p><p>4.  Classes, Builtin types and Extension types.
</p><p>There's one more basic topic that really has to be covered, which is the difference
between classes, builtin types, and extension types.  Classes are the things we've
just covered, whereas builtin types are the basic types such as int, string etc.
provided by Python.  A basic difference between them is that you can't add random
new stuff to a builtin type.  For example, if you write:
<div class="doccode"><pre>
myinteger = 2
myinteger.tag = 'this cool one I just invented'
</pre></div>
you'll get an error, whereas:
<div class="doccode"><pre>
mycircle = Circle(0,0,0,3)
mycircle.tag= 'this cool one I just invented'
</pre></div>
will work fine (assuming you've imported the definition of Circle, etc.).
</p><p>Extension types are types which have been defined in extensions to Python, which in
the case of QuArK Python will have been written in Delphi.  Some important extension
types for QuArK Python are vector and qobject, created by calls such as:
<div class="doccode"><pre>
myvector = quarkx.vect(1, 0 , 10)
face = quarkx.newobj(&quot;top:f&quot;)
</pre></div>
Like classes, extension types have methods (followed by ()) and data members
(not followed by ()), but unlike classes, and like builtin types, you can't
attach random stuff to them. (Note: in recent versions of Python, these differences
have been largely eliminated, but rewriting QuArK to take advantage of this would
be a major enterprise).  The various extension classes that Delphi provides
to QuArK Python are described in the quarkx section of the infobase.
</p><p>An especially noteworthy feature is, that the QObject type in particular is
defined by means of a rather large Delphi class hierarchy; Delphi classes are
also OOP, but different in various ways from Python.  The 'suffixes' to the string
argument passed to quarkx.newobj (&quot;:f&quot;, &quot;:b&quot;, etc.) determine what Delphi type
is used to make the instance of the extension class, and this then determines what
data members and methods are available from Python (e.g. .normal is available for
faces (suffix &quot;:f&quot;), but not polys (suffix &quot;:p&quot;).
