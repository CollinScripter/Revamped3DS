<table border=0 width="100%" cellspacing=10><tr><td><p>The purpose of <a href="intro.terraingenerator.html">QuArK's Terrain Generator</a> is to allow the user to
actually create and edit their terrain at any time during the map
creation process. But with far more control over variation of
terrain size, scale, placement and usage to create unique surfaces
as well as the ability to <a href="glossary.html#p">pull</a> the terrain to existing map items.
</p><p>It is based on the solid <a href="glossary.html#b">brush</a> (<a href="glossary.html#p">polyhedron</a>) format that is now used
in QuArK for any other structure type. However, unlike most terrain
editor surfaces, which are based on units of squares that are converted
to triangles during the map file export process for importing to QuArK,
our terrain surface will start at that triangular unit stage.
</p><p>Also, because the <a href="glossary.html#t">Terrain Generator</a> was created around QuArK, it can
use many of the other existing features and functions that already existed.
The most vital one being <a href="intro.texturebrowser.overview.html">QuArK's Texture Browser</a> which will support
applying, changing and scaling of the terrain texture as it is being created or edited.
</p><p>Another <b>very unique feature</b> of <a href="intro.terraingenerator.html">QuArK's Terrain Generator</a> is its ability to work with not <b>only</b> the <b>'up faces'</b> of the terrain surface, but the <b>'down faces'</b> and <b>both simultaneously</b> as well !!! You can read more about these functions on the <a href="intro.terraingenerator.selection.html">'Menus and Toolbar-icons'</a> page.</p>

</p><p><b>More detail</b> about these steps, additional features and functions are given on their <a href="intro.terraingenerator.html">individual Infobase pages</a>.<br>
But for now we just want to go over a general highlight of its operation.
</p><p>As a general note, <b>none</b> of the <a href="intro.terraingenerator.selection.html">Terrain Generator Selectors</a> or the <a href="intro.terraingenerator.selection.html#paintbrush">Texture Applicator</a> will have any effect on terrain surface areas that are placed in a separate folder that is <b>hidden</b> by using that function which can be accessed using the 
<a href="intro.mapeditor.menu.html#editmenu">Edit menu-View Group</a> on QuArK's main Menubar or by clicking the <a href="glossary.html#l">LMB,</a> with the mouse cursor over that particular folder and selecting <b>Group is hidden</b> from the pop-up menu.

First, a <a href="intro.terraingenerator.setup.html">'Terrain Shape Builders'</a> needs to be selected from the <a href="intro.terraingenerator.selection.html">Terrain Toolbar</a>. There are three patterns to chose from. Here we have chosen the second button from your left, which is the 2X pattern.
</p><p>This will drop a default sized <a href="glossary.html#s">Shape Builder</a> into the editor's view and even though it shows the triangular grid pattern, it is really a single <a href="glossary.html#p">poly</a> at this point.
</p><p>Before it can actually be used to create a terrain there are some basic settings that can be made and the <a href="glossary.html#s">Shape Builder</a> must be <b>Dissociated</b> to create the individual triangular <a href="glossary.html#p">polys</a> that you will be working with.

The next step is to size or <a href="glossary.html#p">pull</a> the <a href="intro.terraingenerator.setup.html">'Terrain Shape Builders'</a> to cover the area that is desired. This is done by clicking on one of its side handles and moving it to where you want while holding down the <a href="glossary.html#l">LMB</a>. This can be done to any or all of its sides. The same goes for its thickness or height by <a href="glossary.html#p">pulling</a> its top and bottom, or down face, handles.
</p><p><b>A word a caution here!</b> Because additional triangular <a href="glossary.html#p">polys</a> are going to be created and their default unit setting is small (32 units per square section) at this time, too large of an area will <b>dramatically</b> slow down your computer. In fact, it can seem to even lock it up! But this is really not the case. If you elect to continue with a large area of small unit size <a href="glossary.html#p">polys</a>, your computer will free up once it has completed calculating and drawing the <a href="glossary.html#p">polys</a> in all of the editors views.

However, there is a built in warning that will appear when you cross this <a href="glossary.html#p">poly</a> count threshold which will allow you to cancel the process and either reduce the area size or increase the unit setting for the grid and thus continue to cover the desired area. This is done by changing the <b>wedgeunits</b> to a larger setting using <b>any</b> amount you wish, so long as the game you are mapping for will support that size setting.
The other two settings, <b>sameheight</b> and <b>detailmesh</b> are covered in detail on the <a href="intro.terraingenerator.setup.html">'Terrain Shape Builders'</a> page.
</p><p>Once this process of resizing and making the setting changes has been completed, you are then ready to <b>Dissociate</b>, or brake apart, the <a href="intro.terraingenerator.setup.html">'Terrain Shape Builders'</a>.
</p><p>To do this, simply <a href="glossary.html#l">LMB</a> click on the <a href="intro.terraingenerator.setup.html">'Terrain Shape Builders'</a> icon in the <a href="glossary.html#t">Tree-view</a> of the editor, then <a href="glossary.html#r">RMB</a> click, to cause its popup menu to appear, and select <b>Dissociate Duplicator images</b>.
</p><p>This function will create the individual triangular <a href="glossary.html#p">polys</a> of the terrain grid and place them into a single folder for that particular <b>Terrain Maker 2X</b> session.
</p><p>As you create other terrain sections, going through the same process, they too will be placed into their individual folders to keep them separate and well organized to work with later as your creation becomes more involved and detailed.
</p><p>The reasoning for this process will become more clear as it is covered further on the <a href="intro.terraingenerator.setup.html">'Terrain Shape Builders'</a> page.
</p><p>You are now ready to start creating the terrain through the use of the  <b>Shaping</b> process.

<p>To start the actual shaping process you need to click on the <b>Basic Selector</b> button of the <b>Terrain modes</b> tool bar, which is the first button to the right of the <b>Selector Dialog Input</b> button shown below. Then in the <b>Top View</b> of the editor hold down your <a href="glossary.html#l">LMB</a> and drag across the desired faces, area, you wish to start creating the terrain shape from. As you are dragging you will see a <b>red rectangular box</b> that will indicate the area you are selecting. Once the area is surrounded, let go of your mouse button and all of those <b>up faces</b> will turn <b>red</b>, indicating what has been selected for movement or <a href="glossary.html#p">pulling</a>.
</p><p>Once a selection has been made like this, you can then activate the <b>Selector Dialog Input</b> button just to the left of the <b>Basic Selector</b> button. This will bring up this particular selector's dialog input box. This <b>Basic Selector Dialog</b> box is <b>only</b> used by the 
<b>Basic Selector</b> button. As future selectors are added, they too can have their own dialog box that will relate to their particular features. This and other detail about the <b>Selector Dialog Input</b> function and  the <b>Basic Selector</b> are covered on the <a href="intro.terraingenerator.selection.html">'Menus and Toolbar-icons'</a> page.
</p><p>The <b>Basic Selector</b> is used for the movement of large areas of terrain surface. For more <b>detailed</b> selection and movement of smaller common face groups and individual faces, see the <a href="intro.terraingenerator.selection.html#touchup">Touch-up Selector</a> section.

</p><p>Although it is not really necessary to use at this point to create your first terrain <a href="glossary.html#p">pull</a>, I wanted to get you familiar with what needs to be done to <b>activate</b> it, its location and general features of its use, which is to change the way the terrain will be created as a <a href="glossary.html#p">pull</a> is taking place. The dialog box can be dragged to any location by placing your mouse cursor over its blue title bar, holding down the <a href="glossary.html#l">LMB</a> and moving it. It can also be resized like any other window and it will remain open and on top of the editor for your use until you click on the <b>X</b> button to close it. The first time you use the dialog box it will have <b>default values</b> already set in it that are also the <b>default settings</b> for that particular <b>Terrain Selector</b>. Once these settings are changed they are stored and saved to keep them the same until you change them again in another session of <b>QuArK</b>.
</p><p>With that covered, you are now ready to drag and shape your terrain. The <b>dialog box</b> can remain open or closed during this process. It is best to use the editors <b>Side</b> or <b>Front View</b> to do the actual dragging of the terrain. Although both, the dragging and selection process, can be done in any of the 2D or <b>3D views</b>. However, you will notice, if you do your dragging in the 3D views, that it will be much slower and jerky in appearance.

<tr><td valign=top align=middle>
<img border=1  align=middle src="intro.terraingenerator.overview.shape2.png">
</td></tr></table>
</p><p>Place your mouse cursor over the <b>center blue movement handle</b> and holding down the <a href="glossary.html#l">LMB</a> slowly move your cursor towards the top of the editor view. You should now see your terrain taking shape as you move your mouse further. If the size and amount of terrain you are moving is not too large, you will also see the changes in all of the other views, including the 3D views, as well. If not, briefly pausing, without releasing the <a href="glossary.html#l">LMB</a>, will allow the editor to <b>catch up</b> for the redrawing of all of the views. This is the process that <b>QuArK</b> has to go through and why, sometimes, you may not see movement in the other views while you are dragging.
</p><p>One other item about dragging. If the <b>3D view</b> should become distorted during a drag, you can usually clear this up by pressing your <b>Tab</b> key a couple of times. This is the <b>Default Hot Key</b> to cause <b>all</b> of the views to be redrawn. This can also be done while you are dragging if need be.
</p><p><b>Control</b> of your mouse movement is the key here! Because of the way that <b>QuArK</b> processes terrain movement, the mouse curser will not remain on the center handle, but will tend to <b>drift</b> above or below it, depending on which direction you are dragging. This is normal. There is also a <b>delay</b> in movement <b>reaction</b> by the editor, for the same reasons, which can sometimes cause a <b>run away</b> effect to the terrain you are dragging. If this should happen, simply stop moving your mouse and <b>release</b> the <a href="glossary.html#l">LMB</a> <b>without</b> canceling your terrain selection. Then click on the center handle again and slowly start your movement in the opposite direction. This will stop the <b>run away</b> movement all together and reset the handle co-ordinances to react properly once again.
</p><p>If you are unable to use the <b>stop and restart</b> method because things have just gone too far already, then use the <b>Edit</b> menu <a href="intro.mapeditor.menu.html#editmenu">Undo / Redo...</a> function which will usually take you back to a safe point from which you can start from again. For these reasons I highly recommend that you save your work and/or make a backup copy as you reach critical stages in your map editing process.</p>

You could, just as easily selected your texture prior to creating the terrain all together. Sometimes this may be desirable as a base and other times it may be better to apply it last or even <b>during</b> the creation process.
