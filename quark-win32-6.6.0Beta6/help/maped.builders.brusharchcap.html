The brush-arch is a collection of brushes designed to fill
in a boxy hole to make it look like an archway.  So a
good way to start would be to make a wall with a hole in it,
perhaps by first making a wall-brush, then a subtractor
brush, then subtracting.  The result might look like this,
where the bottom of the subtractor has then been raised
up a bit in preparation for the next step:

<tr><td valign=top>

left in the archway, <span class="act">'RMB -&gt; Brush Curves -&gt; Arch'</span>:

</p><p><img border=0 align=right src="maped.builders.brusharchcap.arch3.png">
Some additional brushes forming arch-shape (tinted blue
in some views, such as the one to the right) will appear
inside the brush, and if the brush itself
isn't selected, it will be invisible.
</p><p>What's happened is that the original brush has been put
inside a duplicator (you should check this  by fossicking
around in the <a href="intro.mapeditor.dataforms.html#treeview">tree-view</a>),
which makes it invisible unless selected.
By default, four brushes are produced, and there is a gap
in the middle, but this and various other aspects of what
is produced can be changed by changing the
<a href="intro.mapeditor.dataforms.html#specsargsview">specifics</a> of the
duplicator.
</p><p></td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>
</p><p><img border=0 align=right src="maped.builders.brusharchcap.arch4.png">
Now the most important aspect of this way of making an
arch is that it can be changed dynamically, after it's
made.  To see this, click inside its area until the arch
itself disappears, and its `guide brush' appears instead
because it's selected:
</p><p></td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>
</p><p><img border=0 align=right src="maped.builders.brusharchcap.arch5.png">
We can now drag this brush around, and the arch will move,
and more importantly,  we can reproportion the arch by
dragging the individual faces.  Especially, we can change
it's shape inside the hole by dragging the bottom up
and down:
</p><p>Since these are ordinary faces, which provide data to the duplicator
code the makes the arch patches, we can do all the ordinary face
stuff to them, such as tag/glue.

</p><p>So there's the shape; the next problem is to control
the textures.

Arches get the textures for their front and back faces
off the front and back faces of their guide brush.  So all
we have to is to tag some face of the wall (assuming the other
wall bits are properly aligned), then select the front face
of the arch's guide brush, and then <span class="act">'RMB -&gt; Project Texture from Tagged'</span>.
and ditto for the back wall.  The results should look more or
less as to the right (the red line is the part of the outline
of the wall-face that the texture was projected from).
</p><p>If your arch's front or back textures are misaligned, you should fix them now;
if they're not, mess them up and then fix them.
</p><p>The inside of the arch is unfortunately not so straightforward.  It
would be nice if there was some way to wrap the texture on the front
or back onto the inside curve, but there isn't, at least without using
specially pre-prepared and proportioned textures.  So we basically
are stuck with a misalignment here, which can be ameliorated
by using some fairly bland, unpatterned texture on the inside
faces.

But what we can do is get the textures aligned around the inside
of the archway.  The inside faces get
their texture off the top face of the guide-brush.  So basically
what we want to do is wrap that texture onto the two walls.
But somehow everything has to get aligned.  What happens is
that texture is compressed and positioned in such a way that
if the same texture is projected to the top face of the hole
and wrapped down the wall, everything lines up.  So first
put a bland texture on the top face of the guide-brush.
This will produce something like what's to the right, not
very good because of the different texture appearing at
the very top and sides:
</p><p></td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>
</p><p><img border=0 align=right src="maped.builders.brusharchcap.arch8.png">
So Next, tag the top face of  guide brush, then the bottom
face of the brush that's at the top of the whole, and
<span class="act">'RMB -&gt; Texture -&gt; Project from tagged'</span>.  Then the quickest way to wrap
down the sides is to select the sides of the whole, and
<span class="act">'RMB -&gt; Texture -&gt; Wrapping -&gt; Wrap from tagged mirror'</span>.  The result
ought to look like this:

</p><p>In the game, the joins may be unpleasantly visible, due to light
effects, but if there is an arghrad-like editing tool, this can
be fixed by putting the same lightvalue (or equivalent property)
onto the top face of the guide brush and the other faces forming
the opening.  The top-brush's lightvalue (&amp; all other specifics)
will be copied onto the inner faces of the generated brushes.
</p><p>If you put an appropriately patterned texture around the inside
of the arch, and look closely, you'll see
that the texture scale is compressed somewhat on the curved portion;
that's because its being positioned and scaled on the curve so
that it will join up smoothly with what's on the walls, but
the distance around the flat wall face is longer than on the
smooth curve-face.  This is because of a bit of tricky coding
in the duplicator, whereby the texture scale is compressed
just enough so that the distance in texture-space around
the curve equals the distance, w.r.t the top-face scale, around
the three faces defining the arch.

The RMB menu currently at least offers only two basic
shapes (arch/cap, bevel) in two orientations each, but
the 'duplicators' that implement these shapes have a
considerable number of specifics that implement variations.
You can see what these
<a href="intro.mapeditor.dataforms.html#specsargsview">specifics</a> do by making
an arch and experimenting.
</p><p>If you uncheck the 'inverse' specific for example,
the arch will turn into a 'cap'.  In general, inverse shapes are concave,
non-inverse their convex counterparts.
</p><p>Another important specific is 'subdiv'; it's value is a number,
2 upon creation, that determines the number of segments each
arch-half or bevel is divided into.  2 seems to be the minimum
to provide a half-decent appearance; more will of course
imply more polys.  Also there's 'inner'.  There are two ways
of approximating an arc with straight edges, the edges can
lie inside or outside the curve of the arc.  Outside is
the default, checking 'inner' switches to the inner method.
</p><p>Another useful one is 'lower'.  This flips the arch upside-down,
so that the curved surface is a U that you can walk over.
Lower arches take their texture from their bottom ('down')
rather than their top ('up') faces.
</p><p>Also there's 'onside' for caps and arches, and 'standup' for
bevels.  Note that these change the face that the texture comes
off, so for an 'onside' cap/arch, it will be the back face,
for a 'standup' bevel, the top.
</p><p>All of these shapes are good candidates for being 'detail'
in games that support this; since the faces of the brushes
are all ultimately copies of faces in the guide brush,
specifics such as 'detail' (along with lightvalue, etc.)
will be copied from the appropriate face of the guide-brush.
