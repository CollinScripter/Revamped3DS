<table border=0 width="100%" cellspacing=10><tr><td><p>The Path Duplicator is one of the most sophisticated
and powerful ones.  Its purpose is to make it easier
to create tube-like structures such as pipes,
corridors, and paths, by giving you independent
control over the cross-sectional shape of the
structures, as well as the path it takes (so it's
sort of like an 'extrusion' function in a 3D modelling
program).  It overlaps in functionality with the

<p>When you select the path duplicator from
New Polyhedrons|Duplicators &amp; Misc and drop
it into the map, you see the red 'group selected'
square plus a lot of dotted outlines.  That's
because a group is what has been dropped into your
map, and therefore selected.  If you look at the
group in the treeview, you'll see that it contains
one Path Duplicator, and three Path Points.
If you then select the Path Duplicator, a bunch
of handles will become visible, one regular
duplicator handle, and three squarish ones,
which appear to be located at the 'bends' in
a structure.  Drag them around &amp; you'll see that
this is indeed the case.
</p><p>Plus you can RMB on these handles to get menu items
to remove them, and add new ones, thus getting
lots of control over the shape of the path.
</p><p>The path of what?  It's actually a tube, defined
by an ordinary positive brush and a negative one,
you can see them by expanding the Path Duplicator
and then inside of that the group named Template.
What's happening is that the brushes inside the
duplicator are taken as defining the cross-sectional
outline of the shape we're going to make, with
the X-direction being lengthwise.
</p><p>The brushes don't have to be inside of the Template
group, and there can be duplicators there as well,
so the cross-section could involve some complicated
structures (it could be a row or grid of pipes,
for example).

<p>It is also possible to have a structure that is
replicated, or 'tiled', along the length of the
corridor.  Any such things are placed inside
a group named 'Tile', which is treated specially:
brushes in this group don't have their front and
back faces stripped off, &amp; the entire contents
of the group is copied along each branch of the
path as many times as the entire X-axis length
of the stuff in the Path Duplicator will fit
(the contents of Tile are treated just like other
contents of the Path Duplicator for working out
the size of the template).

<p>Sometimes you might want to create some sort of complicated sub-assembly to
connect the segments of the path duplicator (for example to solve texture
alignment problems by having custom textures on the joins).  Elbow-space can
be created with the 'squarend' and 'setback' specifics (of the duplicator itself,
not the containing group).
</p><p>Next, if the angles of the joins are all the same, you can use the 'elbow'
duplicator to make multiple copies of the joining structure, suitably
rotated.  Pushing the elbow button drops an elbow duplicator into the group,
which uses the same path points as the path duplicator itself.  Into this duplicator
put the structure you want to be replicated at the elbows, locating it at the
first elbow (space between first and second path segments).  It might be easier
to line things up if you dissociate the images of the path duplicator first; then
you can use tag &amp; glue operations to join things up (I have tested that the results
can seal against the void).
</p><p>Combined use of the elbows and the 'level' specific could be a reasonable way to
deal with the problem of making a corridor or path that both rises and turns
(horizonatally) at the joints, without twisiting.</p>

<p>I wanted to share this idea I had for a (possibly) different use for 
the path duplicator.  Maybe everyone already does this, but just in 
case...
</p><p>I used to think of the path duplicator as a tool for constructing 
hallways or piping or other symmetrical extruded objects.  But it 
also works very well for constructing non-symmetrical things like 
rooms.  
</p><p>For example, instead of using symmetrical, closed objects for your 
template (like the shape of an &quot;O&quot;), try cutting your template in 
half down the middle (so that it's now shaped like a parenthesis) and 
constructing your tunnel out of two halves.  This makes it very easy 
to widen your tunnel as you go, or have it open up seamlessly into a 
room.  In fact, using this method, you can use your template to 
create an entire oddly-shaped room by extruding the template all the 
way around in a loop.  Drop in a ceiling and a floor and voila!  You 
have yourself an oddly shaped room with almost no work at all.
</p><p>You can create some really cool rooms this way if you get creative 
with the template.  For example, try making your template into the 
shape of a capital &quot;E&quot; and extruding that in a loop.  Suddenly you 
have a room with a walkway around the edge.
</p><p>Anyway, this is how I've taken to making all my maps these days.  I 
keep a set of stylized cross-section prefabs that are all multiples 
of the same size and can be used in different areas of the map.  I 
hope this comes as news to at least a few people.  It has certainly 
made map-making a lot more fun for me.</p>
