<table border=0 width="100%" cellspacing=10><tr><td><p>QuArK writes maps in a considerable range of formats, but also has
the peculiarity of allowing (and indeed in certain ways promoting) the writing of
faces with non-integer coordinates.  This is considered to be profoundly
evil by some people, and can certainly cause problems, although I don't
think it's always so bad (especially for example with non-structural brushes).
At the least, it can create problems in using QuArK together with map
editors that don't tolerate floating point coordinates well.

<p>In Quake-engine games, the faces of brushes are defined by three points, which can
be located anywhere on the face of the plane, as long as they don't sit on one
line (note especially: they do <strong>not</strong> have to be vertexes of the
face, although they can be).  Early Quake editors and the build-tools required
these points to have integer coordinates, but QuArK introduced floating point
coordinates, which allow precise placement of rotated brushes, and are also
necessary for its 'enhanced texture positioning' scheme, which provides more more
flexible texture-positioning than the original 'Classic Quake' system.
</p><p>Unfortunately, floating-point coordinates can also introduce various problem,
especially in conjunction with build-tools that can't read them.  The way they
were involved with enhanced texture positioning is particularly problematic, since
repositioning textures involved moving the face-coordinates, and so could drag
face vertices subtly and unfixably off grid, which tends to drives people crazy,
whether or not it caused real problems.  And furthermore, build-tools that
can't read floating point coordinates are very likely to have problems with maps
written by QuArK, even if floating-point coordinate writing is suppressed (since
the truncations shift the faces around, and thereby can cause leaks).
</p><p>So QuArK 6.3 has a different internal representation for texture-scales than
earlier versions (called 'tv6', since it involves a 'tv6' specific on faces
that specifies 6 numbers), so that moving textures doesn't shift the face
threepoints, and also has some tools for finding and fixing faces with
non-integral threepoints.  The finder, on the search menu, is the 'Find
Non-integral Threepoints' command, and will produce a list of faces with
non-integral coordinates.  Then the fixer, on the commands menu, 'Integralize
Selected Faces', will attempt to fix the selected faces automatically,
by forcing threepoints that are slightly off-integer to integral values,
and also coopting integral vertexes of the faces, if it can find enough.
On exit, it leaves selected the faces it has fixed, so that they can be
inspected (conveniently with 'Browse Multiple Selection' on the Selection
menu) for bad effects on texture-scales, etc.  Then you can run the finder
again to see the recalcitrant cases, and decide what to do about them by
hand.
</p><p>It is quite plausible that you might want to allow certain vertexes to
be non-integral (for decorations, etc); if a group has a 'nonintegral'
specific, the finder will ignore the nonintegral faces within it.
</p><p>With these tools, and the 'Don't Write Floating Point Coordinates' map
option, it will hopefully be possible to control floating point issues
adequately.

<p>Aside from the floating point issue, map formats have two aspects: features which
are supported by particular games, such as texture-flags, etc, and features that
are supported by particular buld-tools.  The first are controlled by a combination
hard-coding in the QuArK exe and some not-easily-editable flags in the setup
files, while the latter are selected in the `Output Map Format' dropdown box in
the configuration section for each game.
</p><p>The currently supported main types, choosable in the Output Map Format box,
are:
<UL>
<LI>Classic Quake: the original, with hardcoded variants for Quake1/2/3,
Hexen II, Sin.  Limited in the range of texture positioning and scaling
it can code.
</p><p><LI>Quark etp: a variant of Classic Quake in which the texture position and
scaling is given by the face threepoints, with a `TX' code 1 or 2 to indicate
whether the texture should be mirror-imaged or not.  This gives full
flexibility in positioning textures, but makes essential use of floating-point
face-coordinates, and therefore <I>may</I> be associated with
some small errors in vertex positioning (it's not certain that this is
really a problem in output maps).  The 'tx' versions of qbsp for Q1 and Q2,
and Zoner's tools, have full support for etp; other tools may or may not
handle it with various degrees of success.
</p><p><LI>Valve 220: Valve's enhancement of Classic Quake.
</p><p><LI>Brush Primitives: Id's enhancement of Classic Quake, for Q3 and RCTW
(will probably be supported for any games that GtkRadiant comes to support).
</UL>
The configuration defaults are set for the build-tools recommended on the
QuArK homepage; don't change them unless you have some idea what you are doing,
or are experimenting in order to more closely attain this exalted state.
</p><p>Two other format options you can teak in the Map|Options section of the
config screen are whether or not to write comments, and whether or not
to write floating-point coordinates in the map files.  QuArK normally writes
a fair amount of information about brush-numbering etc. into maps; this may
cause problems for some build-tools, so the first option suppresses it.
The second option simply truncates the floating point coordinates, which can
cause problems, although it again might be necessary to use in conjunction
with certain build-tools.  So this option should probably only be used in
conjunction with the floating-point control techniques discussed above, to
suppress floating point coordinates in structurally important brushes.</p>

<p>Because the representation of texture scales in QuArK 6.3 is different from
that of 6.2, some care should be taken with transferring projects.  First,
make sure the project is backed up, then open it in 6.3 and make sure
that the scales look correct, and that it builds correctly.  Then, as
you further edit the map, faces that are operated on will shift their
texture-representation to the new one, so keep an eye on things to make
sure nothing is going wrong.  If problems occur, announce them to the
<a target="_blank" href="http://quark.sourceforge.net/forums/">QuArK forum</a>, so we can figure out what has gone wrong.
</p><p>QuArK 6.2 will not correctly read .qrk's and .qkm's written by QuArK 6.3,
so migration to 6.3 is basically a one-way street (we could probably
come up with a retrogression tool if one was really wanted, but
no guarantees; 6.3 is supposed to be better!)
