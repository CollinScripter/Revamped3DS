An <a href="glossary.html#e">entity</a> is usually an object in the game, that the player can interact
with. There are two types of entities:
</p><p><ul>
<li><img width=16 height=16 align=absmiddle src="maped.tutorial.entities.image19b.png">&nbsp;
    Point-entities: Monsters, Respawn points, Light-sources, Controller-entities...

    Brush-entities: Doors, Buttons, Trigger-areas, Non-solid walls...

shown in the image.

<img width=132 height=68 align=right src="maped.tutorial.entities.image20.png">
To create a entity in QuArK, you choose it from either the
<a href="intro.mapeditor.userdata.html">prefabs / userdata panel</a> or by clicking
on the &nbsp;<tt>new item</tt>&nbsp; icon which will bring up the
<a href="intro.mapeditor.misctools.html#newmapitem">New map items...</a> window,
from where you also can choose between the different entities.
</p><p>Let's try it out. Create a &nbsp;<tt>info_player_start</tt>&nbsp; point-entity, by clicking
on the &nbsp;<tt>new item</tt>&nbsp; icon, and find the entity in the folder named
something like 'Player starts'. Then double-click on it, to bring it into the
map.
</p><p><img width=159 height=164 align=right src="maped.tutorial.entities.image22.png">
Some of the point-entities have a <a href="glossary.html#b">bounding-box</a>. This usually indicates,
that the monster, player or 3D-model is that large, and the point-entity should
not be embedded (either partly or whole) into brushes, as the monster/player
will then get stuck.
</p><p>As the info_player_start entity has such a bounding-box, you should carefully
place it inside your room. Make sure it does not touch any of the walls or the
floor/ceiling. You may need to
<a href="intro.mapeditor.toolpalettes.display.html#zoom">zoom in</a> and change the
<a href="intro.mapeditor.toolpalettes.display.html#grid">grid size</a> to place it
just right.
</p><p>Whenever you have marked an entity, and if the entity requires it, you might
see an &nbsp;<tt>entity pointing angle</tt>&nbsp; handle, or &nbsp;<tt>ball-handle</tt>&nbsp; as some
call it. This will allow you to quickly control in what direction the entity
should face, or move at. The ball-handle can be set in these positions; 0-360
degrees (0-360), upwards (-1) or downwards (-2), all depending on the game.
</p><p><img width=162 height=85 align=right src="maped.tutorial.entities.image23.png">
When you create a &nbsp;<tt>brush-entity</tt>&nbsp;, QuArK will automatically create a new
brush and assign it to the newly created entity.
</p><p>If you do not want that brush, you can &nbsp;<tt>expand</tt>&nbsp; the brush-entity object
in the tree-view, by clicking on the little
<img width=11 height=11 align=absmiddle src="maped.tutorial.entities.image23b.png"> icon (Just like in
Windows' File-explorer), then select the brush in the brush-entity and delete
it.
</p><p>This is also the way to add more brushes to a brush-entity. The entity has to
be expanded, or empty (not having brushes assigned to it), for you to be able
to drag and drop a brush into it. All this can only be done in the
<a href="intro.mapeditor.dataforms.html#treeview">'Tree-view (hierarchy-view)'</a>.

There is another little feature in QuArK. You can have any of the
<a href="intro.mapeditor.dataforms.html">data views</a> open at all times. You do
this by clicking on the tap for the view, and drag it to the place you want to
drop it at.
</p><p>Try to do it as shown in the image. Drag the
<a href="intro.mapeditor.dataforms.html#specsargsview">specifics/args view</a>
out, and drop it somewhere.
</p><p>Okay, so whats this specific/arg thingy then? Well, all entities requires some
parameters, which the game-engine uses to figure out what the entity is and
what it is supposed to do. These parameters are called &nbsp;<tt>specifics</tt>&nbsp; and
&nbsp;<tt>arguments</tt>&nbsp; in QuArK. You could call them the entity's variables and
values, if you want it in programming-terms.
</p><p>A specific that must always exist for every entity, is the &nbsp;<tt>classname</tt>&nbsp;
specific. This is the 'variable-name' that the game-engine knows about, and ask
what its argument (value) is. In the case where you have created a
info_player_start entity, the classname argument is &nbsp;<tt>info_player_start</tt>&nbsp;,
and so the game-engine knows that this entity will act as a info_player_start,
and runs code to make it so.
</p><p>QuArK uses the argument of the classname specific in its tree-view. You can try
to rename the info_player_start object in the tree-view, and see that it will
also change in the specifics/args view too. Remember to undo your changes, so
the info_player_start comes back again.
</p><p>Some point-entities require a point in 3D-space, to know where it must exist.
This is the &nbsp;<tt>origin</tt>&nbsp; specific. It has tree arguments; X, Y and Z. QuArK
has to know this origin, in order to show the entity in the 2D-views. However,
since you can control the position of point-entities in the 2D-views, you never
have to modify the arguments for the origin specific.
</p><p>There is also another specific that QuArK knows about; &nbsp;<tt>angle</tt>&nbsp;. Whenever
this specific is present in the entity's specifics/args view and have an
argument, and you have selected then entity, the &nbsp;<tt>entity pointing angle</tt>&nbsp;
(ball-handle) will appear in the 2D-views. Try to change info_player_start's
angle argument to some other value between 0 and 360. You will notice that the
ball-handle will reflect the change.
</p><p>Setting values for an entity, is just the matter of typing them into the
argument of the correct specifics, or selecting the proper checkboxes or
listbox-items, that is shown in the specifics/args view for the entity. Notice
that the listboxes are editable, so if you can't find an item in the list, you
have to type it yourself.
</p><p><img width=192 height=109 align=right src="maped.tutorial.entities.image25.png">
You can add new specifics to your entity, by clicking on the &nbsp;<tt>plus icon</tt>&nbsp;
in the specifics/args view. This will give you a new line, where you have to
rename the specific and give it an argument. You can of cause also delete a
specific/arg by first selecting the specific and press the &nbsp;<tt>minus icon</tt>&nbsp;.
However, some specifics might not disappear when you try to delete them. That
is because these specifics are instructed to be available for input, and usually
part of the entity, that the game-engine parses.

<p>As much as QuArK helps you along the way, giving you a wide array of entities,
and within them their specifics and argument, you have to seek information
about how to use the entities yourself, by;
</p><p><ul>
<li>reading documents and tutorials,
<li>searching the web,
<li>asking for help in news-groups and mailing-lists,
<li>study entities in <a href="glossary.html#fileext">.MAP</a> and <a href="glossary.html#fileext">.BSP</a> files made by other people
<li>and generally THINK, EXPERIMENT and LEARN.
</ul>
</p><p>You will find out that, even though the games that QuArK supports, are all
based on the Quake-engine series by <a href="glossary.html#i">id Software</a>, some entities do not
act in the same way. An example:
</p><p><blockquote>
Creating a semi-transparent window...
<ul>
<li>Quake-1: You can't! However, there is a way to make an invisible inpassable window, but it will bleed when shot upon.
<li>Quake-2, Heretic-II, Sin: The face-flags controls whether the brush is transparent or not.
<li>Half-Life: Can only be created by brush-entities. Some special specifics/args controls the transparency.
<li>Hexen-II: I don't know, but the game is based on the Quake-1 engine, so the same thing might apply.
<li>Quake-3 Arena: Use or create a <a href="glossary.html#s">shader</a>, to be applied on the brush.
</ul>
</blockquote>
</p><p>The more information you seek out, the better equiped you are to make good maps.
See also <a href="intro.basicknowledge.html#entitiesforgame">'Entities and other features that depend on the game only'</a>.
</p><p>Okay enough of that. Lets put a light-source into your first room. I'm not
going to tell you how, because as stated above; Think, Experiment and Learn.
</p><p><img width=162 height=185 align=right src="maped.tutorial.entities.image26.png">
Once you have put that light-source into your room, you are ready to build
(compile) your map, and test it in the game. To build, you have several options
in the game menu in the map-editor; &nbsp;<tt>GO!</tt>&nbsp;, &nbsp;<tt>QuickGO!</tt>&nbsp; and
&nbsp;<tt>Complete rebuild</tt>&nbsp;.
</p><p>I suggest you activate the &nbsp;<tt>QuickGO!</tt>&nbsp; function, as this will; make QuArK
export a .MAP file, run some of the build-programs, and then start the game you
have choosen from QuArK Explorer Games menu.
</p><p>Errors might appear, like you haven't told QuArK where it can find the
build-programs, then go to the <a href="intro.configuration.games.html">'Games'</a> for the
choosen game, and correct the problem.
</p><p>Other errors can come from the build process, and here you have to find out
what is wrong, and try to fix it yourself
(see also <a href="intro.basicknowledge.html#compilingmaps">'Compiling maps'</a>). Of course, if its way
over your head, you can write a message to the <a target="_blank" href="http://quark.sourceforge.net/forums/">QuArK-forum</a> asking
for help. Just make sure you have supplied enough documentation on the error
you get, so others can understand your problem.
