<p>QuArK 6.3.0 has been released; there is also an update patch, and there
will very likely be a 6.3.1 with some minor bugfixes and improvements.
Probabl that will be that.
</p><p>First, what what has been implemented in QuArK 6.3.0, at least as much of it
as we remembered to record!  The now uninformative 'status' info (e.g.
'done') has been removed, but some of the more contentful ones have been
left.  Feel free to add additional features to this list that QuArK actually
acquired but got left out.
</p><p><ul>
<li>6DX Engine Support: (decker, Jacob Marner)
</p><p><li>Crystal Space Support: (tiglari, funkiedamouse)
</p><p><li>Linear Matrix editor: (tiglari, lots of design from Rolf Hulsbergen)
<br>crank out matrices for rotation, scaling
etc. from intelligible parameters (from pushbutton in duplicator
forms).
</p><p><li>Extruder: (tiglari)
<br>generate brushes etc. from 2d outlines.
<br>status: done (integrates with path duplicator); some extensions
currently being added.
</p><p><li>'New Copy One' duplicator: (tiglari)
<br> put copies of a structure where you want it.  Inspired
by a suggestion by Meatball402 on Quake3World editing forum.
</p><p><li>User-configurable hot keys: (tiglari)
<br>What additional ones should be added?
</p><p><li>User-specifible rotation/linear mapping origin: (tiglari)
<br>Do they really need to be persistent properties of groups?
(as opposed say to a tagged point)
<br>what about axis? No, wouldn't integrate with the buttons.
<br>status: redone as handle (old origin duplicator removed
from interface).  Works as fixpoint for scale/rotate linear specifics
in some duplicators.
</p><p><li>Merge Polys: (tiglari)
<br>bugs fixed, merge all mergeable polys in group
</p><p><li>Form-editing: (Andy)
<br> Includes create capacity.
</p><p><li> Entity Extractor: (Andy)
<br> Entities extracted from .bsp's in many formats
(including Q3(T)A).  Runs out of memory on some maps in some .pk3's.
This can be worked around by extracting the .bsps to individual
files.
</p><p><li>Selection modes: (tiglari)
<br>Configuragle 'Aux Keys', by default 'F' for face, 'B' for brush,
'C' for curve, 'E' for entity (point or brush).  'P' and 'F' don't have
drilldown, this is a bit asymmetrical but I don't think it really matters.
</p><p><li>L-square enhancements: (tiglari, ax2grind)
<br>status: started, align &amp; glue to tagged done.  I intend
to leave further enhancements as an exercise for someone who
wants to learn more about QuArK-Python programming.
</p><p><LI>Tree navigation: (tiglari, design from Decker, realdespair)
<br> home, pg up, pg down for parent, next prev in group, cycling.
Plus some kind of option for getting next-of-same-type in group.
<br>status: basic stuff done.  Perhaps add more refined same-type
option (=classname for point entities, brush entities, =macro
for duplicators)
</p><p><li> Entity Lump Extractor: (tiglari)
<br> extracts entity lumps from .bsp's in a .pak to independent files.
<br> status: done but seems to fail with STVEF .bsp's whose names
begin with underscore.  More thought about easy preparation of
entity addons is needed.
</p><p><li>3point cutting plane: (tiglari)
</p><p><li>Pythonify entity def converters: (Andy)
</p><p><li>texture search facility: (Andy, suggestions from quantum_red)
</p><p><li>storable camera positions: (tiglari, design from quantum_red)
</p><p><li>group selection movement commands: (tiglari, design from Alan Donald and quantum_red)
<br>exchange position &amp; align (WC-style)
</p><p><li>incrementable specifics in duplicators: (subnoodle, tiglari)
<br>status: done except for radial duplicator.
</p><p><li>texture-replacement specifics for duplicators: (tiglari)
<br>status: done except for radial.
</p><p><li>promotion/demotion of submenus: (tiglari)
<br>status: done for texture &amp; tagging (not intended
for all submenus, just some of the more useful ones)
</p><p><li>Code specifics for toolbar buttons: (Andy)
</p><p><li>Support for Gunman, Blue Shift &amp; other HL derivatives: (Decker)
</p><p><li>Arg Replacer: (decker)
</p><p><li>Show/edit entities for supported games bsp's: (tiglari)
<br>status: done except for Sin (a fourth bsp structure
probably over-strains the present code structure).
</p><p><li>Inspect nodes &amp; planes in bsps: (tiglari)
</p><p><li>Object snapper: (tiglari, idea from quantum red)
<br> align/move object w.r.t. face so that face and
a face of the object are paralell.
</p><p><li>Object slider enhancement: (tiglari)
<br>Now moves object over plane and along normal.
</p><p><li> Don't draw restricted out stuff: (tiglari)
<br>when hide-out-of-view is checkd.
</p><p><li> Search for defective textures: (tiglari)
<br>whose scales are too small (request from rust QuArK forum)
</p><p><li>'Move containing' item on the vertex RMB: (tiglari)
<br>that moves the parent item selected from the submenu so that
the vertex becomes on-grid (solution to problem from the RQF)
</p><p><li>'Output Map Format' field in game configs: (tiglari)
<br>replacing some of the Map Options.
</p><p><li>various selection modes: (tiglari)
<br>frozen selections (shift RMB) that don't change until another
frozen selection is made, selection of brush, face, patch, entity only,
done via 'auxiliary keys' (hold down during mouseclick).  Frozen
selections appear to be at least a partial implementation of a suggestion
by rd.
</p><p><li>bilinear filtering option in texture views: (tiglari)
<br>prodding from aguir_re.
</p><p><li>Support RTCW, JKII, Torque, partial support for Mohaa.
</p><p><li>bilinear filtering option added to OGL view: (tiglari)
<br>prodding from aguir_re, facilitated by a nice intro OGL
tutorial from which some code could be cribbed, also I suspect
some previous cleanup by Decker.
</p><p><li>Fixed problem with 2-monitor usage of QuArK:
<br>breakthru insights from quantum_red and Decker.
</p><p><li>Radiant-style dragging, with frozen selections: (tiglari)
<br>The justification for this is that I think it might be fast
and convenient in certain cirucmstances. (Also a 'how it was done'
story might be a good QuArK-Python tutorial on handling mouse stuff.)
<br>status: <strong>done</strong>
</p><p><li>Basic SoF2 support: (tiglari, CHK Shoot)
</p><p><li>jump-pad trajectory calculator: (decker)
</p><p><li>non-integral face finder-fixer: (tiglari)
</p><p><li>liner mappings work on path duplicator: (tiglari)
</ul>
</p><p>And in future updates + 6.3.1.
<UL>
<LI> enhanced wallmaker: (tiglari)
<br>status: done in current update patch
<LI> target finder: (tiglari)
<br> status: done in current update patch
<LI> enhanced prism builder: (ax2grind, cdunde)

<br> information from Bengt Jardrup:
<br>Tiglari, if you take a look at the Q1 compilers at my site 
<div class="doccode"><pre>
&gt; http://user.tninet.se/~xir870k , you'll find that both of them 
&gt; already have a leak line &quot;simplification&quot; algorithm default active 
&gt; that significantly reduces the leak trail length and complexity. As a 
&gt; result, the .pts file size shrinks significantly. For large leaky 
&gt; maps, this is an enormous advantage.
&gt; 
&gt; This algorithm was originally designed by Greg 'Tree' Lewis and 
&gt; fixed/improved by Tyrann and me. The algorithm can be found in source 
&gt; file outside.c and is called SimplifyLeakline.
</pre></div>
</p><p><li>Mixed-face contents finder: (tiglari)
<br> suggestion by funkiedamouse.
</p><p><li>More flexible greyout: (suggestion by quantum red)
<br>Provide an option so that things are selectable when
visible in only one view.
</p><p><li>Patch bend mode: (tiglari)
<br>Or something like it, and other patch-handling extensions.
</p><p><li>Ripoff of WC `arch maker': (tiglari)
<br>would be called something like`arc builder', probably
basically a duplicator, emulating the wc thing's functionality.
</p><p><Li>Finish support for Mohaa: (tiglari)
<br>Needs info about lod terrain format, model format and where
the entity editing info is stored.
</p><p><li>A Radiant-style XY view with vertical Z window: (tiglari)
<br>The justification being that that gives maximal screen real estate
for the top-down view (if you think about it, it's an extreme development
of the Classic QuArK view).
</p><p><li>importable and exportable config info (some discussion of this
in early May2002 on quark-python)
</p><p><li>L-square menu enhancements: (tiglari, ax2grind)
<br>status: started, align &amp; glue to tagged done.  I intend
to leave further enhancements as an exercise for someone who
wants to learn more about QuArK-Python programming.
Suggested additions are:
<UL>
<LI> checkbox for relative to tagged/join of L
(better to just tag the join, I think now)
<LI> move to fraction of distance to tagged (arm only)
<LI> end position
<LI> arm length
<LI> arm angle
</UL>
What about L-join options?
</p><p><li>Radiant-style Regioning: (?)
<br>Hide and don't write to map everything not in the rectangle.
</p><p><li>Tag side plugin: (tiglari)
<br>More flexibility for wrap across tagged.
</p><p><li>Brush-based shape-builders: (tiglari, Decker)
<br>'inner boxes' (two independently manipulable boxes, one inside
   the other, giving more control over arch shapes).
<br> redo prism-builder as shape-builder.
<br> more fancy options for stair-builder
</p><p><li>Patch-based shape-builders: (tiglari)
<br> sphere, 'inner boxes', 'square cylinders' (s/b easy, but no
requests for it)
</p><p><li>full equivalence to GtkR patch texturing: (tiglari)
</p><p><li>Expand/Contract faces: (tiglari)
<br>As enhancement to experimental mapmovevertex plugin
<br>Plus extension of vertex locks to ordinary vertex dragging.
</p><p><li>CTF duplicator: (tiglari)
<br>status: started, nothing committed.
</p><p><li>Model Editor: (Andy, tiglari?)
<br>more progress
</p><p><li>Incorporate 'entity info files' into toolboxes: (tiglari)
<br>tiglari has PERL scripts that generate various kinds of info (hints, bounding
bpxes etc) from Radiant .def files and other sources, the idea being to
let these be automatically integrated into the toolboxes generated
by Andy's addon-builder.

<p>My current thought is that QuArK 7 should involve some major under-the-hood
revamping, in particular of the relation between QObjects and Python classes,
so that QObject is a 'new style class', subclassable in Python.  This would
be an important step towards actually getting somewhere with Quarkplusplus
(the project of translating QuArK to C++), or to much more extensive
Pythonification, using Psyco to achieve adequate performance.  Splitting the
Python codebase and the Delphi into two separate neat piles would also be
needed. Python should only handle the plug-ins, Delphi should do the hard
work, like vertex handling.
</p><p>One of the major things that should be changed, is the way Args/Specifics
are stored. There ought to be a third list, which contain the type of data
stored. How else could one tell the difference between a number 3 stored
as a 2 byte variable, and number 3 stored as a 4 byte variable? This would
also allow easier distinction between numbers, string, color codes, images,
etc...
</p><p>Further down the line, QuArK 8 should involve a rework of the GUI, which
is presently Python-scripting piled on top of heavily hacked Delphi 2
vintage VCL. Or even a complete port to C++.

'project from nearest plane', emulating classic qe texture
alignment: the projection of the texture scale on the closest
axis plane to the tagged face normal is found, then that is
projected onto the tagged face. (tiglari)
</p><p><li>Optional plugins:
<br>Some plugins wouldn't load unless they were 'registered'
like addons; this would make it easier to try things out
<br>Alternative: plugins with 'expmap', etc. prefixes which
would only load when a 'load experimental plugins' option was
checked.

<li>Edit textures in .bsp files:
<br>an as-yet-unimplemented 4.7 feature, unlikely to be implemented
since it makes it too easy to rip off other people's work.
</p><p><li>Map reconstructor for Q3 engine games:
<br>This might be easier to do well for Q3 engine
games because the model structure seems to include
brush info as well as face info.  But same problem as Edit textures
in .bsp above.
</p><p><li>Daikatana support: (?)
</p><p><li>Adquedit-equivalent resource display for Q1: (Seth)
<br>That is, edit *all* Q1 engine game resources.  This might
become more viable if QuArK gets involved in the Q1-engine source
port scene.

<p>Ambitious, not necessarily realistic proposals, ranging
from the relatively straightforward to crazed dreams.  More likely
as Quarkplusplus features.

</p><p><li> Auto-binary qrk:
<br>When a text-based .qrk is loaded, write a binary format equivalent
with extenion .brk; then next time load that unless the .qrk is newer
(same logic as .py and .pyc).
</p><p><li>Model editor: (Andy, tiglari)
<br>export closed mesh to brushset
</p><p><li> NetQuark: (???)
Multi-user editing over the net.  Would need somebody who
really knows what they're doing.  Probably not a
realistic target.  Support for collaboration via CVS might be
more plausible.  Unlikely to be build, would need a entire
rebuild of the code.  Maybe an idea for Quarkplusplus?
</p><p><li>persistent edits: (?)
<br>undo/redo info written to files/saved with maps,
supporting playable entity demos (Ax2grind idea),
and 'orthogonal persistence' (http://www.tunes.org)
of editing sessions
</p><p><li>XML support: (?)
<br>Maximum possible compatibility with GtkRadiant Xmap, which doesn't
seem to be going anywhere at the moment.
</p><p><li>Qrk editor: (?)
<br>Edit .qrk's in the style of a decent XML editor
<br>Andy's form-editing extension to the explorer are basically
implementing this.
</p><p><li>Integrated Dynamic bsp builder: (?)
<br>bsp building &amp; optimization while u're scratching
ur head...
</p><p><li>Surf Inspectors: (?)
<br>Laid out more like in Radiant, which I like
better than Quark's long list.
</p><p><li>More Game Formats: (?)
<br>Unreal engine, Serious Sam, Far Cry...
<!-- Heroes of Might and Magic (Quark was
used some internally for either the one coming out now or the one
before it, so maybe this one has a chance). 
DanielPharos: First of all, I think it's Might and Magic, no Heroes
of Might and Magic. Second, I can't find anything proving this...-->
