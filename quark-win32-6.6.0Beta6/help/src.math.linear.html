<p>One of the most important aspects of vector spaces (sets
of vectors with their associated math operations such as\
addition) is that they have 'bases', or coordinate systems.
A basis is just three vectors, taken in a definite order,
which don't lie on the same line or plane.  We are usually
interested only in bases where the vectors are of
length 1, and are perpendicular to each other; these
are called 'orthonormal bases' if you want a technical
term for them.
</p><p>The most familiar (orthonormal) basis is:
<div class="doccode"><pre>
xa = &lt;1, 0, 0&gt;
ya = &lt;0, 1, 0&gt;
za = &lt;0, 0, 1&gt;
</pre></div>
(In vector algebra books these are often called <b>i</b>,
<b>j</b> and <b>k</b>; I'm using xa, ya and za for x-axis,
y-axis and z-axis.)
</p><p>The most important fact about bases is that any vector can
be expressed as a sum of (scalar) products of the basis
vectors by numbers.  In the case of the standard basis
[xa, ya, za], we have the obvious identity:
<div class="doccode"><pre>
x*xa + y*ya + z*za = &lt;x, y, x&gt;
</pre></div>
However it's also true for arbitrary bases, and even more
usefully, if [xr, yr, zr] is a randomly chosen basis, we
can get the coordinates of any vector v with respect to
that basis by using the dot product:
<div class="doccode"><pre>
v = (xr*v)*xr + (yr*v)*yr + (zr*v)*zr
</pre></div>
(Possibly a bit confusingly, the '*' inside the parentheses
represents the dot product operation two vectors, yielding
a number, while the '*' outside the parentheses represents
the scalar product, multiplying a vector by a number).

<p>Technically, a linear mapping is a function making vectors
from vectors that obeys this law, where L is the mapping,
a and b are numbers (scalars), and v and w are vectors:
<div class="doccode"><pre>
L(a*v + b*w) = a*L(v) + b*L(w)
</pre></div>
</p><p>It is an immedidate consequence of the definition that if [x,
y, z] are the coordinates of a vector v w.r,t, a basis xb,
yb, zb, then the result of L on v can be predicted from v's
coordinates, plus what v does to the vectors of the basis:
<div class="doccode"><pre>
L(v) = x*L(xb), y*L(yb), z*L(zb)
</pre></div>
We can say that [L(xb), L(yb), L(zb)] are a 'replacement
basis' for the original basis (this isn't a standard term,
but I think it fits).  There's one respect in which a
replacement basis isn't like real basis: its vectors can
all lie in the same plane or line, or even be 0
</p><p>Not only does every linear mapping produce a replacement
basis, but the reverse is true: if we pick three vectors
at random, [xr, yr, zr], we can make a linear mapping out
of them by choosing a (real) basis, and then transforming
a vector v with coordinates &lt;x, y, z&gt; as follows:
<div class="doccode"><pre>
M(v) = x*xr + y*yr + z*zr
</pre></div>
If you crank thru the algebra you'll see that M is a linear
mapping.  So for a given basis we've decided to use,
every linear mapping produces a (unique) replacement basis, and
every replacement basis produces a (unique) linear mapping.
</p><p>This is very nice, because a linear mapping is a sort of
abstract transformation of space, but a replacement basis
is just a sequence of vectors.  And if we're doing 3D
math, it will just be nine numbers.  And there is
a convenient package for delivering these numbers in, a
matrix.  A matrix is in general just a grid of numbers,
m rows and n columns, for basic 3D math we're interested
in 3x3 matrices.
</p><p>In the standard presentation, the first, second and third
columns of the matrix represent the first, second and
third members of the replacement basis (important: columns,
not rows).  QuArK python conforms to this in that
if the arguments of quarkx.matrix(...) are three vectors,
they will be taken to be the columns of the matrix (whereas
if the input is tuples or a string, it's row-by-rlow).
</p><p>Then the rules of matrix multiplication have been set up
so that if M is a matrix and v is a vector (thought of
as a single column, constituting a 1-column matrix),
M*v is the result of applying the mapping represented
by M to v. Technically, these columns (both the columns
of the matrix representing the linear mapping and the
single columns representing the vectors), are taken to
be the coordinates of vectors (the input and output vectors,
and the replacement basis vectors) with respect to some
basis.  But in QuArK Python (and other computational vector
and matrix sytems) we don't have to worry about this kind
of thing, since we're taking the standard basis as the
fundamental one.
</p><p>Most of the time the basis we're most interested in is
the standard one, which I'll repeat here:
<div class="doccode"><pre>
xa = &lt;1, 0, 0&gt;
ya = &lt;0, 1, 0&gt;
za = &lt;0, 0, 1&gt;
</pre></div>

<p>For one example, consider rotations.  Suppose we want to rotate by a degrees
around the z axis. from elementry trig and some visualization
you can see that the result of this will be to transform
the x, y and z axes as follows:
<div class="doccode"><pre>
xa = &lt;1, 0, 0&gt;  -&gt; &lt;&lt;a&gt;cos(a), sin(a), &gt;&gt;
ya = &lt;0, 1, 0&gt;  -&gt; &lt;-sin(a), cos(a), 0&gt;
za = &lt;0, 0, 1&gt;  -&gt; &lt;0, 0, 1&gt; (no change)
</pre></div>
So in quarkpy.qeditor.py, we find this function to
define the matrix for rotation by an angle rad (specified
in radians):
<div class="doccode"><pre>
def matrix_rot_z(rad):
    sin, cos = math.sin(rad), math.cos(rad)
    return quarkx.matrix(
       (cos, -sin, 0),
       (sin,  cos, 0),
       ( 0 ,   0,  1))
</pre></div>
(Remember that when the input to quark.matrix is specified
as three tuples, they are rows.)  There are similar formulas
for rotations around other axes.
</p><p>'Scaling' is linear transformations that make things bigger
or smaller by proportional amounts.  To scale something
by the factors x, y and z along the respective axes, this
matrix would be used:
<div class="doccode"><pre>
x   0   0
0   y   0
0   0   z
</pre></div>
As usual, each column represents what the mapping does to
the corresponding coordinate vector.
</p><p>For most uses of linear mappings, we don't want to use them
on their own, but need to combine them with another kind
of mapping, 'translations'.  Linear mappings always leave
the origin &lt;0, 0, 0&gt; untouched; a translation adds the same
amount to everything, thereby shifting the whole space by
a certain amount in a certain direction.  Now suppose we
have an object sitting in our map, centered say at the
point &lt;100, 250, 920&gt;.  If we just applied a rotation to it,
it would rotate around the map origin, which is probably not
what we want.  What we probably want to do is first apply
a translation so that the point we want it to rotate around
is now the map origin, then apply the rotation, and then
apply the reverse of the translation.  QuArK Python
provides a quick way of doing this with the 'linear' method:
if say we have a group grp, grp.linear(v, m) will apply the
linear mapping represented by the matrix m to the group, using
the point represented by v as the origin).  This will also work
for duplicators if their 'applylinear' method is properly
defined (which, for certain of the more recent and complex
ones, it isn't).
</p><p>In many applications what we want is not exactly a
linear mapping, but an 'affine mapping'; which is a linear
mapping followed by a translation (the offset).  For example
texturing a face.  Conceptually, this is a mapping from the
two-dimenensional texture plane, tiled with the texture
image, onto some face.  We can make it three-dimensional
(and thereby get to use QuArK's matrix facility, by adding
a z-dimension, which does nothing, to the substantively useful
s and t dimensions (conventionally used instead of x and y for
textures).  The texture threepoints for
a face (face.threepoints(2)), (p0, p1, p2) are the images of the
texture origin, s axis and t axis under an affine map.
The translation component of the map is represented by
the vector p0, while the linear component has the matrix:
<div class="doccode"><pre>
quarkx.matrix(p1-p0,p1-p0,quarkx.vect(0, 0, 1))
</pre></div>
(It's best to make no change for the formally necessary
but substantively useless z component).
</p><p>The matrix for the texture scale can be used for complicated
things such as aligning textures on faces and bezier patches,
or converting texture positioning information between
different formats.
</p><p>Here is a somewhat complex example, finding a series of point
that will constitute the outline of a 'warped circle' inscribed
in a quadrilateral (for possible use in a prism builder, for example).
The actual routine is warpedCircleFrom4Points(n, points), from
quarkpy.maputils.  points is supposed to be a list of four
points, the corners of the quadrilateral, while n is the number
of points we want to generate.
</p><p>The basic intuition is that we think of our quadrilateral as
warped square, so that our warped circle will be a warped version
of real circle, touching the square at the midpoints of the edges.
But since all four corners of the actual quadrilateral might
be different, we really have to think of it as four perhaps
differently warped quarter circles.
</p><p>So the strategy will be to generate n-1 angles in succession,
performing the following operations on each:
<ul>
<li> select the corner of the quadrilateral &amp; adjust the angle
appropriately
<li> find the point in the ideal quarter circle produced by
the adjusted angle
<li> map this point into the corresponding actual point on the
warped circle.
</ul>
The first step isn't very interesting, and is acheived by the
code down to the comment 'get point in quarter-circle resting in
the axes' (just note that each corner is constituted by the corner
point and the midpoints of the two edges that meet there).  The
next step is basic trig, and performed by
<div class="doccode"><pre>
        point = quarkx.vect(1.0-math.sin(angle*deg2rad), 1.0-math.cos(angle*deg2rad), 0)
</pre></div>
(the idea here is that we're generating points on a circle of unit
radius centered on the point (0,0)).  So the next line is:
<div class="doccode"><pre>
        mat = matrix_u_v(corner[1], corner[2])
</pre></div>
where matrix_u_v(u,v) creates a matrix whose first column is u,
second column is v, and last column is <0,0,1> (it's assumed that
the third coordinate of the vectors to be mapped by this matrix
will always be 0, so the last column of the matrix doesn't
really matter; however a safer choice might be to use something
based on the cross-product of the input vectors).  Then comes
the payoff line:
<div class="doccode"><pre>
        circle.append(corner[0]+mat*point)
</pre></div>
corner[0] is the map-location of the actual corner point,
point is the ideal location on the quarter-circle, and multiplying
by mat converts this into the actual position on the warped
quarter-circle.  This procedure generates n-1 of the n-points
we want, the first is just a mid-edge (warped circle
tangent) point.
</p><p>And last comes the interesting bit.  Because we can make a matrix
for a linear mapping out of the images that it produces for the
coordinate axes, we get therefore get a linear mapping to warp
our quarter-circle by thinking of the two arms of the warped
corner as images of the clean, 90 dgree unit length corner.
So there it is, and, slightly amazingly, it seems to work :)
</p><p>The same technique is employed in quarkpy.b2utils for generating
bezier control points for bevels in the function
arcSubdivideLine(n, p0, p1, p2), but the details are a bit
different because on the one hand we're dealing with quarter
circles rather than full circles to begin with, but on
the other we need to generate control points that lie off
the circle in order to get the patch to bend, which involves
a bit of implicit (one variable) calculus plus calculating line
intersections.

<p>For more sophisticated applications, we need to get straight
on the difference between 'points' and 'vectors'.  Although
vectors are widely used to represent points, there is an
important difference between them: vectors can be added to
each other, and multiplied by numbers, but these operations
make no sense for mere points.  What they do make sense for
is <strong>relationships</strong> between points.  If we have
points <b>a</b> and <b>b</b>, it make sense to look for a
point <b>c</b> that is in the same direction from <b>a</b>
as <b>b</b> is, but twice as far away.
