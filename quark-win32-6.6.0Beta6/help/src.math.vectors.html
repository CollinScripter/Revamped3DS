<p>Here is a rather short introduction to vectors, in certain
respects rather philosophical, but also with reference
to QuArK's vector facilities.  The first few chapters of
books on 'vector calculus' are a good source for this
kind of material, although fortunately there's little need
to wade very far into them (I learned a lot from
Marsen &amp; Tromba (1976) <U>Vector Calculus</U>, Freeman
and Co., the material here being covered in Chapter 1).

<p>'Vector' means 'carrier' in Latin.  Hence rats as plague
vectors.  In mathematics, the most basic meaning is
a relationship between two points, namely, the
displacement that would carry one into the other, and
also a sequence of numbers representing that displacement,
such as 2 units forward, 3 to the left and 1 up, giving
the vector &lt;2,3,1&gt;, or quarkx.vect(2,4,1) in QuArK
Python programming.  We'll call the relationships between
points 'geometric' vectors, the sequences of numbers
'sequence' vectors (this isn't standard terminology, but I
find it useful).
Since only the sequence vectors can be manipulated
by computer programs, in a sense they are the only ones
that are relevant, but on the other hand what the programs
are doing is helping people to build their spatial
imaginings, so I personally think it's helpful to have
a solid grasp of the relationship between the sequence
vectors and the geometrical ideas they represent.
</p><p>Geometrical vectors can be 'added'
in the sense of performing one displacement after another,
and also multiplied by numbers, in the sense of performing
the displacement a (possibly fractional or irrational)
number of times.  Similarly, the sequence
vectors can be added by adding the numbers in the
corresponding positions, or multiplying all the numbers
by the same number:
<div class="doccode"><pre>
&lt;x, y, z&gt; + &lt;u, v, w&gt; = &lt;x+u, y+v, z+w&gt;
a*&lt;x, y, z&gt; = &lt;a*x, a*y, a*z&gt;
</pre></div>
In jargon, for sequence vectors, addition of vectors and
multiplication of a
vector by a 'scalar' (an ordinary number, in context where
vectors are the focus of attention) are defined
'componentwise'.
</p><p>The components are of course the individual numbers, and if
v is a QuArK vector, we can get its first, second and third
components as v.x, v.y and v.z respectively (there are also
5-component vectors for use with bezier patches, with .s and
.t in addition, but we won't worry about those here).
</p><p>If we're using the number sequences to represent
displacements, we can see that the algebraic definition
agrees with our intuitive conceptions of how addition of
displacements and the multiplication of a displacement
by a number should work, and if you crank through the
algebra you should be able to see that all of the standard
sequence laws such as commutative and associative
work, for those combinations to which they are applicable.
For example:
<div class="doccode"><pre>
(a+b)*(v+w) = a*b + a*w + b*v + b*w
a*(b*v) = (a*b)*v = (b*a)*v = b*(a*v)
</pre></div>
Vector algebra or calculus textbooks will give complete
lists, but basically it's just Junior Hi-level algebra.
</p><p>And in QuArK python, + works for vectors, and * will
combine a vector and a float, the only difference from
standard math notation being that you can also put the
float second, or use the division symbol in the usual
way:
<div class="doccode"><pre>
(1/a)*v == v*(1/a) == v/a
</pre></div>
(if v is a vector and a is a float).
</p><p>It is also usual for vectors to be used to represent points,
but there's a issue here: it makes no sense to add
points to each other, or multiply them by numbers.  What's
going on is that to represent a point by a vector, we first
need to pick a special point called the 'origin'.  Then we can
use vectors to represent other points as relationships to (i.e.
displacements from) the origin.
</p><p>So at this point we have three somewhat different kinds of things
floating around:
<UL>
<LI> Geometric vectors: relationships between points in space, independent
of any representation, by number-sequences or otherwise, with the conceptions
of addition and multiplication.
</p><p><LI> 'Sequence vectors':  sequences of numbers (in this case sequences
of length 3, tho there are other possibilities), with the componentwise
addition and scalar multiplication.
</p><p><LI> Geometric points in space: relationships between these give geometric
vectors, which can be represented by sequence vectors given some further
arrangements, which we'll be looking ito shortly.
</UL>
</p><p>To get a geometric vector from a point, we need an origin
point; how do we get an sequence vector from a geometric one?
What we need is three vectors of length one, all perpendicular
to each other, taken in a definite order.  This is called
an 'orthormal basis', 'ortho-' meaning perpendicular, 'normal'
meaning of length one, and 'basis' being a math term whose
true meaning we won't reveal quite yet.  The vectors in the
basis are by convention associated with the x, y and z axes,
and often designated as <b>i</b>, <b>j</b> and <b>k</b> in
3D math books.  Given an orthonormal
basis, we can represent a geometric vector by the sequence
of numbers indicating how far you go in the direction of each
vector of the basis, taken in order.
</p><p>It's an essential point that the representation of geometrical
vectors by sequence vectors has an arbitrary aspect: given a
different choice of basis, there will be different numbers.
Suppose for example we have an orthonormal basis
<b>i</b>, <b>j</b> and <b>k</b>, and replace <b>j</b> with
-<b>j</b>.  What will happen to the sequence vector
representing a given geometric one?
</p><p>To represent a geometric vector with an sequence vector(in
the standard way; there are some other possibilities), we
need an orthonormal basis, but we don't need an origin.
But to represent a point as an sequence vector, both an
origin and an orthonormal basis is required: the origin lets
us represent a point with a (geometric) vector, and the
basis lets us represent the geometric vector with an sequence
one.  We find out more about this in the next section.
an origin with an orthonormal basis is a 'coordinate system'.

<p>The dot product (also sometimes called the 'inner
product') might be the leading 'value for money'
vector operation, since its definition is simple and
its results extremely useful.  For sequence vectors,
we can define it like this:
<div class="doccode"><pre>
&lt;x,y,z&gt;*&lt;p,s,t&gt; = x*p + y*s + z*t
</pre></div>
In other words, to compute the dot product of
two vectors, multiply their corresponding components,
and add the results.
</p><p>In QuArK python, the dot product is represented
by the '*' symbol, so that if u and v are vectors,
'u*v' will be their dot product, a number.  If you
crank through the definition, you can work out that
the dot product obeys many (but not quite all)
applicable instances of the
associative and commutative laws, such as (where u and v are
vectors, and a is a number):
<div class="doccode"><pre>
u*v = v*u
a*(u*v) = (a*u)*v
(a+b)*u = a*u + b*u
a*(u+v)  = a*u+a*v
</pre></div>
One that doesn't work is:
<div class="doccode"><pre>
(u*v)*w = (u*w)*v  (NOT!!)
</pre></div>
where u, v w are all vectors.
</p><p>One aspect of the geometric significance of the dot
product is that we can use it to compute the length
of a vector:
<div class="doccode"><pre>
length(v) = sqrt(v*v)
</pre></div>
This follows from the Pythagorean formula for the
hypoteneuse (long side) of a right triangle, generalized
to give the diagonal of a box.  However we don't actually
have to know this for QuArK Python, since the abs()
function delivers the length of a vector.  Also in
QuArK Python, the square root function needs to be preceded
by 'math.', since it's part of the math module, so we
can render the above equation into an always-true
QuArK Python statement as follows:
<div class="doccode"><pre>
abs(v) == math.sqrt(v*v)
</pre></div>
This illustrates a very important feature of the dot
product, which is that even though we compute it from
coordinates, which depend on a choice of a basis, it is
actually independent of the exact choice of basis: no matter
what basis we chose to get an sequence vector w representing
a geometric vector v, the dot product w*w will be the same.
This means that we can think of the dot product as
a property of geometric vectors, as well as sequence
ones.
</p><p>A further essential fact about the dot product is that if
the dot product of two sequence vectors is zero,
then the geometric vectors they represent, with
respect to any coordinate system, will be zero.  So
we have a fast and easy to compute test for
perpendicularity.  A typical application is determining
whether a point lies on a plane.
</p><p>One way to represent a plane is to pick one vector
p representing a point on the plane (it doesn't
matter which one), and another vector n to represent
a 'normal' to the plane, that is a line perpendicular to it. (If
(If the plane is thought of as dividing space into an 'inside'
and an 'outside', there is an essentially arbitrary
convention that the normal sticks into the outside.
So the direction handles sticking out of faces in
QuArK are normals to the face plane, pointing in the
conventional direction).  The plane will then be
defined as all points v such that the vector from v
to p is perpendicular to n.  And given a point v, we
can test it for lying on the plane by seeing if
n*(p-v) equals the 0 vector &lt;0,0,0&gt;.
</p><p>The &lt;0,0,0&gt; vector evaluates to 'false' in a QuArK
Python conditional, so a piece of code might be:
<div class="doccode"><pre>
if not n*(p-v):  # if v lies on the plane defined by p, n
  [do something]
</pre></div>
Recall that when we're using vectors to represent points
(v and p), we're assuming a prior choice of origin, but
n is a direction, so doesn't require an origin, and notice
that p-v will be independent of the choice of origin,
since if you move the origin by say some vector d, d
will be addeed to both v and p, and so cancel out in their
difference.
</p><p>The perpendicularity test provided by the dot product
is a consequence of something more general, which we
push on to investigate.
</p><p>Suppose we have two vectors, u and v, which we represent as
lines in space going from an arbitrarily chosen origin to the
point that the vectors relate to that origin, and we draw a line
from the end of u so that it intersects the line that v
extends along, and is perpendicular to v.  The relation
between the origin and this intersection point is then
a vector, which might point in the same direction as
v, or the opposite one.
</p><p>This vector is called 'the projection of v onto u'; note
that it depends on the length and direction of v, and
the direction of u, but <strong>not</strong> on the
length of v.  The big news is that projection of u onto v,
which we've defined geometrically, can be computed algebraically
using the dot product:
<div class="doccode"><pre>
proj(u,v) = ((u*v)/abs(u))*u
</pre></div>
The ability to compute these projections is something we
can put to use in various ways. 
</p><p>Suppose we have a point v, and a plane defined by a point
v and a normal vector n, and what we want to do is to
'project' the point v to the plane along the plane's normal,
that is, find a vector that is perpendicular to the
plane that will take v onto a point in the plane (this
might be part of a routine to attach an object to a face,
for example).  Now we already have one vector (p-v) that
will take p onto the plane, but this isn't the one we
want because it might not be perpendicular to the
plane.  But we can fix this by projecting (p-v) onto
the normal.  The resulting vector will be parallel to
the normal and therefore perpendicular to the plane,
and the line connecting its end to v will also be
perpendicular to the normal, so its satisfies the test
above for being on the plane (you should try to visualize
this too, to see intuitively that it makes sense).
</p><p>And since plane normals, including the output of face.normal
in QuArK Python, are by convention of length 1, we can drop
the abs(u) term from the computation, and find the vector
proj taking v onto the plane by computing:
<div class="doccode"><pre>
proj = ((p-v)*n)*n
</pre></div>
And if we want the actual point, we just add proj to v.
</p><p>A more general version of this is to project a point to a
plane along any normal; that's what the procedure projectpointtoplane
in quarkpy.maputils does.  The idea behind that code is to take
two dot products of the plane normal, one with the vector from
the point we're projecting from to the point that defines the
plane, the other with the vector we're projecting along.  These
are used to compute a ratio, by which the 'along' vector is
multiplied to produce the projection vector.
</p><p>A final, easier, example is the 'perptonormthru' procedure,
also in quarkpy.maputils.  Here the idea is that we're given
a 'source' point, a (sort of) 'destination' point, and a normal
vector thru the destination point.  The idea is to find vector
that's perpendicular to the normal, going from source to a point
on the line of that normal (so the destination)
is only a sort-of destination.  So the idea here is to compute
the projection of (source-dest) onto norm, then subtract that
from (source-dest) to get the desired answer.  This procedure is
used in various ways, for example in computing the circumference
of prism-shaped brushes with irregular ends in the texture-wrapping
code.
</p><p>And finally we come to the most general and important application.
Suppose u is coordinate axis of a basis. Then u*v
is v's coordinate for that axis, w.r.t. the basis.
So out of all of this we have gotten a way to compute the
coordinates of a vector w.r.t a new coordinate system.
This is very convenient.  Suppose we've worked out the
coordinates of a bunch of points, and suddenly decide that
we need them w.r.t a different coordinate system.  It would
be annoying to have to pull out our surveying gear and measure
everything again, but thanks to the dot product we don't
have to.  All we have to do is get the coordinates of
the new origin (w.r.t the original coordinate system),
call it <b>o</b>, and of the new basis vectors.
If <b>v</b> is an
sequence vector representing a point in the old
coordinate system, and <b>ax</b> is an axis vector
of the new basis, then (<b>v</b>-<b>o</b>)*<b>ax</b>
will be <b>v</b>'s ax-coordinate in that basis, also with
three computations of this nature, one for each of the
new axes, we can get the new coordinates.

<p>Now we move on to a rather more complicated operation,
the cross product.  What this is useful for is finding
vectors that are perpendicular to other vectors.
Unfortunately most of the applications of this
in the code seem to be involved with more advanced things
such as matrices, but hopefully these basic facts
will be useful, especially that when a cross product
is used, the motive is generally to find a vector
that's perpendicular to two that are already in hand.
</p><p>The full algebraic definition of the cross product is
rather complicated, and for QuArK programming, there's
no real reason to know it, since it's computed by the
'^' operation:  'u^v' is the cross-product of u and v.
But although we don't need to know how to compute it,
we do have to know something about its properties.
</p><p>The most important property is that if u and v don't
lie on the same line (which implies that neither is the
<b>0</b> vector), then u^v is perpendicular to both u and v.
Otherwise u^v is the <b>0</b> vector (and isn't really useful
for anything, afaik).  Another useful fact is that if
u and v are the unit vectors along the x and y axes,
respectively, then u^v is the unit vector along the z
axis.  Since these unit vectors are standardly
designated <b>i</b>, <b>j</b> and <b>k</b>, we have:
<div class="doccode"><pre>
i ^ j = k
</pre></div>
</p><p>More generally, we'd like to know how to tell:
<UL>
<LI>how long u^v is
<LI>which way it points
</UL>
The length turns out to be abs(sin(th))*abs(u)*abs(v),
where th is the angle between u and v.   More relevant
for QuArK is the direction: there is a principle called
the 'right hand rule' for figuring out the direction
of a cross-product: if v goes perpendicularly through
the palm of your right hand, with your fingurs curling
around so that they point towards u, then your thumb
points in the direction of u^v.
</p><p>If you work through this you'll see that there is a
consequence that u^v does not equal v^u, but point in
the opposite direction, so we have:
<div class="doccode"><pre>
u^v = -(v^u)
</pre></div>
There are other algebraic facts about the cross product
to be found in math books, but I have yet to find them
useful for QuArK Python.
</p><p>The cross product can not only be used to manufacture a
z axis from suitable x and y axes, but it can also be
used to make an orthonormal basis from any two non-colinear
vectors.  Suppose we have u and v, and want u to be the
x axis, and v to lie in the xy plane.  Then we can get
the direction of the z axis by taking u^v, and given
the z axis, we can get the direction of the y axis
as (u^v)^u.  Symbolically, using <b>i</b>, <b>j</b>,
<b>k</b> as the unit vectors for the three axes:
<div class="doccode"><pre>
i = u.normalized
j = (u^v).normalized
k = j^k  (normalization not needed here)
</pre></div>
