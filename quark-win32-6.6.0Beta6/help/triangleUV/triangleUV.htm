        <h2>Same Side Technique</h2>
        <p>
        A common way to check if a point is in a triangle is to find the vectors 
        connecting the point to each of the triangle's three vertices and sum the 
        angles between those vectors. If the sum of the angles is 2*pi then the point 
        is inside the triangle, otherwise it is not. It works, but it is very slow. 
        This text explains a faster and much easier method.
        <p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <td><img src="diag01.gif"></td>

                        First off, forgive the nasty coloring. I'm really sorry about it. Honest.
                        <p>
                        Okay, A B C forms a triangle and all the points inside it are yellow. Lines AB, 
                        BC, and CA each split space in half and one of those halves is entirely outside 
                        the triangle. This is what we'll take advantage of.
                        <p>
                        For a point to be inside the traingle A B C it must be below AB and left of BC 
                        and right of AC. If any one of these tests fails we can return early.

        <p>
        But, how do we tell if a point is on the correct side of a line? I'm glad you 
        asked.
        <p>
            <img src="diag02.jpg"><br>
            If you take the cross product of [B-A] and [p-A], you'll get a vector pointing 
            out of the screen. On the other hand, if you take the cross product of [B-A] 
            and [p'-A] you'll get a vector pointing into the screen. Ah ha! In fact if you 
            cross [B-A] with the vector from A to <i>any</i> point above the line AB, the 
            resulting vector points out of the screen while using <i>any</i>
        point below AB yields a vector pointing into the screen. So all we need to do 
        to distinguish which side of a line a point lies on is take a cross product.
        <p>
            The only question remaining is: how do we know what direction the cross product <i>should</i>
        point in? Because the triangle can be oriented in any way in 3d-space, there 
        isn't some set value we can compare with. Instead what we need is a reference 
        point - a point that we know is on a certain side of the line. For our 
        triangle, this is just the third point C.
        <p>
            So, any point p where [B-A] cross [p-A] does not point in the same direction as 
            [B-A] cross [C-A] isn't inside the triangle. If the cross products <i>do</i> point 
            in the same direction, then we need to test p with the other lines as well. <i>If 
                the point was on the same side of AB as C and is also on the same side of BC as 
                A and on the same side of CA as B, then it is in the triangle.</i>
        <p>
        Implementing this is a breeze. We'll make a function that tells us if two 
        points are on the same side of a line and have the actual point-in-triangle 
        function call this for each edge.

                    It's simple, effective and has no square roots, arc cosines, or strange 
                    projection axis determination nastiness.

                <h2>Barycentric Technique</h2>
                <p>
                    The advantage of the method above is that it's very simple to understand so that 
                    once you read it you should be able to remember it forever and code it up at 
                    any time without having to refer back to anything. It's just - hey the point 
                    has to be on the same side of each line as the triangle point that's not in the 
                    line. Cake.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Well, there's another method that is also as easy conceptually but executes 
                    faster. The downside is there's a little more math involved, but once you 
                    see it worked out it should be no problem.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So remember that the three points of the triangle define a plane in space. Pick 
                    one of the points and we can consider all other locations on the plane as 
                    relative to that point. Let's go with A -- it'll be our origin on the plane. Now 
                    what we need are basis vectors so we can give coordinate values to all the 
                    locations on the plane. We'll pick the two edges of the triangle that 
                    touch A, (C - A) and (B - A).  Now we can get to any point on
                    the plane just by starting at A and walking some distance along (C - A) and
                    then from there walking some more in the direction (B - A).
                </p>
                <p>
                    With that in mind we can now describe any point on the plane as
                </p>
                <pre>    P = A + u * (C - A) + v * (B - A)</pre>
                <p>
                    Notice now that if u or v < 0 then we've walked in the wrong
                    direction and must be outside the triangle.  Also if u or v > 1
                    then we've walked too far in a direction and are outside the triangle.
                    Finally if u + v > 1 then we've crossed the edge BC again leaving the triangle.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Given u and v we can easily calculate the point P with the above equation,
                    but how can we go in the reverse direction and calculate u and v from a given
                    point P?  Time for some math!
                </p>
<pre>
    P = A + u * (C - A) + v * (B - A)       // Original equation
    (P - A) = u * (C - A) + v * (B - A)     // Subtract A from both sides
    v2 = u * v0 + v * v1                    // Substitute v0, v1, v2 for less writing
    
    // We have two unknowns (u and v) so we need two equations to solve
    // for them.  Dot both sides by v0 to get one and dot both sides by
    // v1 to get a second.
    (v2) . v0 = (u * v0 + v * v1) . v0
    (v2) . v1 = (u * v0 + v * v1) . v1

    // Distribute v0 and v1
    v2 . v0 = u * (v0 . v0) + v * (v1 . v0)
    v2 . v1 = u * (v0 . v1) + v * (v1 . v1)

    // Now we have two equations and two unknowns and can solve one 
    // equation for one variable and substitute into the other.  Or
    // if you're lazy like me, fire up Mathematica and save yourself
    // some handwriting.
    Solve[v2.v0 == {u(v0.v0) + v(v1.v0), v2.v1 == u(v0.v1) + v(v1.v1)}, {u, v}]
    u = ((v1.v1)(v2.v0)-(v1.v0)(v2.v1)) / ((v0.v0)(v1.v1) - (v0.v1)(v1.v0))
    v = ((v0.v0)(v2.v1)-(v0.v1)(v2.v0)) / ((v0.v0)(v1.v1) - (v0.v1)(v1.v0))
